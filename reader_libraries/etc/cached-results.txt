Google loves MARC records from our community for this very reason.
We endured the loss of our friend and mentor Dan Marmion together a year ago September when Marc wrote a letter which I read at the memorial service.
Marc is passionate about ITAL and its legacy, and I hope he’ll see the future ITAL as a worthy successor to, rather than an unfortunate break from, the journal he’s stewarded for the past several years.

They must form the basis of an international MARC project.
They must now be brought together in an international MARC network.
The strength of the MARC format for computer operations lies in its specificity.
Taken together, all of these considerations make most systems and library technical people hesitate to recommend any major changes to the MARC format at this time.
The computer operations that utilize the MARC formats exist under the constraints of a variety of internal processing formats and design constraints.
Taken by itself, the MARC format is no more difficult to work with than any other standard or technique for both librarians and computer people.
Someone needs to be thinking about and designing the ultimate, comprehensive MARC format-not to be implemented, but to serve as a springboard for discussion and for consideration of system design.
We need to establish limitations on what we will handle with the MARC formats and where we will begin to rely on underlying formats instead.

REPORT OF MARC USER'S DISCUSSION GROUP.
Staff of the MARC Development Office give serious consideration to every proposed MARC change and its impact on the MARC subscribers.
Each MARC subscriber evaluates a change in light of his operational requirements.
MARC CHANGES
It has the effect of maintaining a consistent data base for all MARC users.
The MARC advisory committee will solicit opinions from MARC users as to whether or not to include the change in the MARC Distribution Service, and LC will abide by the committee's recommendation.
2. Consultation with the MARC advisory committee.
The MARC advisory committee will be responsible for submitting the proposal to the MARC users and notifying the MARC Development Office of the committee's recommendation.

It was through Z39 that MARC became the American National Standard (Z39.2-1911).
MARC, by the way, is also ISO standard 2709.
s-n These will be called MARC LC and a distinction between the two will only be made if necessary.
In Canadian MARC a slightly different approach has been worked out.
NYPL, MARC LC, and Canadian MARC only call on it if other more efficient methods (see later) fail.
After BNB MARC, MARC LC and Canadian MARC also introduced this technique.

Hopefully, someone will solve the problem explicit in these forms of MARC.
As a result, until someone solves this problem, we are all without MARC.
MARBI and LC have worked out a procedure whereby all proposed changes to MARC are submitted to MARBI.
