This involves the generation of information to aid discovery.
Cataloguing and classification was revealed as an area of library and information science that has survived years of neglect by most library schools to reveal itself as the much-needed solution to online resource accessibility.
Library catalogue platforms need to be developed to compete with the intuitive interfaces, powerful search engines and the ability to aggregate similar resources offered by commercial services.
The list was based upon current Library services and consisted of the following: Support library catalogue searching Display opening hours (pulled from the Library Web site so data can be maintained in one location)
Offer feedback option After reviewing this list, it was decided to leave out the searching of the Library Catalogue feature as the Library's discovery tool (Ex Libris’s Primo

The Library is developing a national discovery layer, which will harvest the metadata for all research outputs from individual institutional repositories and provide cross-searching services.
Describing materials at collection level provided a new route for discovery.

Library catalogues typically consist of a collection of bibliographic records that describe published materials, usually as the name implies in the form of printed books but also including cartographic materials, music scores and manuscripts.
The library cataloguing method, creating bibliographic records for Internet resources in library catalogues.
Library catalogues record, describe and index the resources of a collection or group of collections.
Description Library cataloguing rules contain rules for the description of library materials.
Resource discovery and metadata One area where libraries and other information professions will have an interest is in ensuring that the wide variety of scholarly publications available online can be discovered and accessed by users.
Some areas of development are especially important as they can lever significant expertise and knowledge within the library, museum and archival traditions to provide new types of service: Resource discovery services.
The case of the catalogue is especially interesting, where there is a growing desire to provide a discovery experience in another environment (a standalone catalogue application with more features, from other databases, from Amazon, from reading lists or social bookmarking systems, and so on).

There may be many discovery environments, which then need to locate resources in particular collections.
We will see a variety of ways of connecting the catalogue to large-scale discovery environments.
Discovery and Location Are Different Functions Elsewhere, I have suggested [5] that we can think about some distinct processes discover, locate, request, deliver in the chain of use of library materials.
Now, historically the discovery and location processes were tied to each other in the catalogue.
In this way the discovery process was tied to the location process, and indeed the catalogue is still closely tied to local inventory management.
In effect they appear to be trying to make discovery of the catalogued collection a part of a broader discovery experience encompassing those parts of the collection which are in library control: local digital collections, institutional repository, catalogue.
Of course, some of these discovery environments may be outside the library altogether.
In one scenario, which may become more common, discovery options may connect to materials available for purchase (either by the user, or by the library on an on-demand basis).
We are now seeing scenarios emerge which make the catalogue experience similar to the historical situation with journals where we need to connect a discovery layer (which may represent much more than is in the local collection) with the ILS to locate instances of discovered items in the local collection.
The current catalogue will need to be blended in some way with the discovery apparatus for local digital collections, for materials available through resource-sharing systems, for materials available for purchase (either by the user, or by the library on an on-demand basis), for the journal literature, and so on.
Search engines, RSS feeds, metasearch engines: these are all places where one might discover library materials.
The question now is not how we improve the catalogue as such; it is how we provide effective discovery and delivery of library materials in a network environment where attention is scarce and information resources are abundant, and where discovery opportunities are being centralised into major search engines and distributed to other environments.
I have referred to some throughout; here is a non-exhaustive list of current examples: Local Catalogue Discovery Environments There has been a recent emphasis on the creation of an external catalogue discovery system, which takes ILS data and makes it work harder in a richer user interface.
Shared Catalogue Discovery Environments We also observe a greater trend to shared catalogues, often associated with resource-sharing arrangements.
Syndicated Catalogue Discovery Environments Increasingly, the library wants to project a discovery experience into other contexts.
And we will certainly see greater consolidation of discovery opportunities in the library space.
The Discovery Deficit: The Catalogued Collection Is Only a Part of the Available Collection I am thinking of two related things here.
These systems include discovery systems for other collection types (the institutional repository, or digital asset repository, etc); the emergence of a general search/resolution layer within the library; external environments as different as Google and Amazon, the RSS aggregator, or the course management system.

Union catalogues existed for co-operative cataloguing but the records were downloaded to the library’s ILS and public discovery was mainly at the local level, supplemented by abstract and index databases (A&I).

This Library’s goal, as those who have visited previously will know, is to acquire or otherwise collect and (eventually) to catalogue all expressions of human knowledge.
The library has redesigned its underlying infrastructure for all its discovery services, and developed a new discovery service which has many features for both data engagement and social engagement.
As cataloguing and metadata librarian, I am interested in the challenges faced by cataloguers in the age of resource discovery systems and how these tools have been influenced in their development by Internet search engines and Internet search behaviour.
Research plan: Create scaleable discovery services using distributed middleware techniques.
Where they are held centrally, typically by the national library, then discovery services are available via the online catalogue, services based on interoperability standards such as the OAI-PMH (Open Archives Initiative-Protocol for Metadata Harvesting), Z39.50 and SRU (Search/Retrieve via URL), full text indexing by Google, and so on.
Although this work is still in progress, thus far we have successfully integrated the digital content into the Library’s existing discovery mechanisms and created new discovery routes via interpretive content and tools such as tailored subject browse, full-text search within items, and an engaging timeline application.
Discussions within included the discover-locate-request-deliver concept, a detailed 2006 analysis of the future of the catalog, SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and its relevance to librarians, discovery layers and content demand issues, and the relationship between the concepts of 'discovery' and 'discoverability'.
The resources have been described and catalogued by subject and by resource type in order to facilitate their discovery.
This is essential to the discovery functionality of HLMS; The integration of collection level descriptions as a metadata standard for describing resources and to facilitate discovery and organisation of resources; The provision of simple and advanced searching, searching simultaneously across multiple databases and recovery of records with a variety of data structures; Results are displayed while the search process is ongoing and in a number definable by the user.
The Catalogue can be searched or browsed.
Working with the RDN Amazon Web Services Library catalogues are another resource discovery service that feature highly in the experience of students and researchers.

In addition to providing support for these search and exposure protocols, the National Library of Australia (as part of its contribution to the ARROW consortium) has developed a National Discovery Service
The Catalog Enrichment Initiative [27] lists different possible elements for enhancing library catalogues and points out that all must support item identifiers and information about the data provider.

Webscale discovery is a development by Serials Solutions, the ability to search within articles etc and the merging of metadata, including data in the cloud around the article.
All applications were first checked against the Library catalogue and holdings and if the item was not in stock, the request was processed and sent to the Uncover service.
The collection descriptions contain data which identify the mechanism for searching a collection or catalogue.
the catalogue will develop into a resource discovery mechanism libraries will develop from being institution based to being domain-based, large nation wide libraries specialized in one subject.
