Web scale discovery services are designed to provide indexing and searching User Experiences, not only for the library’s holdings (as with a traditional Online Public Access Catalog), but also for many of a library’s licensed and open access holdings.
A single identifier system, not restricted to the library world and bibliographic metadata, could facilitate globally unique identifiers for each authority and therefore improve discovery of resources within a catalog.
The catalog and discovery systems remained available, and staff continued to fill article and book chapter requests through interlibrary loan and document delivery.
This is likely due to the increased reliance on the library’s discovery tool, which includes records for all materials held in the catalog.
INTRODUCTION Discovery environments are ubiquitous in academic libraries as all but two libraries in the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) report using a discovery environment, and they continue to gain traction in other library settings.1 The one-stop shopping model of discovery environments is one of their most alluring features as it closely resembles searching the open web.
Usability Test Results for a Discovery Tool in an Academic Library Jody Condit Fagan Meris Mandernach Carl S. Nelson Jonathan R. Paulo Grover Saunders INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARIES | MARCH 2012 83 ABSTRACT Discovery tools are emerging in libraries.
This article will be of interest to those who are investigating discovery tools, selecting products, integrating discovery tools into a library web presence, or performing evaluations of similar systems.
INTRODUCTION Discovery tools appeared on the library scene shortly after the arrival of next-generation catalogs.
The authors of this paper define discovery tools as web software that searches journal-article and library-catalog metadata in a unified index and presents search results in a single interface.
Breeding also recognized the limitations of next-generation library catalogs and saw discovery tools as their next step in evolution: “It’s all about helping users discover library content in all formats, regardless of whether it resides within the physical library or among its collections of electronic content, spanning both locally owned materials and those accessed remotely through subscriptions.”
The library catalog is, perhaps, a more straightforward tool than a discovery tool and attempts to provide access to a smaller set of information.
Catalogs and subject-specific databases still perform some tasks much better than discovery tools, but libraries will need to investigate how to situate the discovery tool and specialized tools within their web presence in a way that will make sense to users.
Numerous options for discovery currently exist, and these include Summon from Serials Solutions, Primo from Ex Libris, WorldCat Local from OCLC, EBSCO Discovery Service, and Encore from Innovative Interfaces.
Investigations into Library Web-Scale Discovery Services Jason Vaughan INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARIES | MARCH 2012 32 ABSTRACT Web-scale discovery services for libraries provide deep discovery to a library’s local and licensed content and represent an evolution—perhaps a revolution—for end-user information discovery as pertains to library collections.
Given that these web-scale discovery services include or even primarily focus on indexing a large amount of scholarly research, such services can serve as another tool in the library’s arsenal.
Detailing the contents of “hidden collections” within the Libraries and seeking to make a concrete determination that such hidden collections, in their current form, would be discoverable via the new system.
The following items are important to have in the discovery system . . .
Do you have any other local “homegrown” collections – hosted by other systems at your library or institution – whose content has been harvested into the discovery solution?

Are ILS bibliographic records from other customers using your discovery platform exposed for discoverability in the searchable discovery instance of another customer?
Ever since North Carolina State University announced a partnership with the commercial-search corporation Endeca in 2006, librarians have been interested in the next generation of library catalogs and more broadly, discovery systems designed to help users discover library materials, Figure 1.
Additionally, next-generation catalogs offer a search mechanism that focuses on discovery rather than simply searching for library materials.

A number of library discovery systems already exist, most backed by open-source or commercially available back-end search engines (table 2), which handle the nitty-gritty, low-level ingestion, indexing, and retrieval.
While the recommendations within this report are the result of planning to develop one particular library discovery system—the eXtensible Catalog (XC)—these lessons can inform the development of other systems as well.

The library catalogue in the new discovery environment: Some thoughts.
Lifting out the catalog discovery experience.
OCLC Research frequently notes the potential streamlining of library cataloging by FRBRization; in addition they have experienced “superior presentation” and “more intuitive clustering” of search results when the model is incorporated into systems.35 Work-level definitions stand behind such OCLC Research prototypes as Audience Level, Dewey Browser, FictionFinder, xISBN, and Live Search.
The software has some ILS features, including cataloging, catalog (search and find), loan, and report modules.
M any libraries are looking for ways to facilitate the discovery process for users.
This is a system design concept that has been discussed in the literature on improving subject TOWARD A TWENTY-FIRST-CENTURY LIBRARY CATALOG | ANTELMAN, LYNEMA, AND PACE 131 access but has not until now been manifest in a major catalog implementation.
As front-end systems, these discovery platforms provide library users with one-stop access to their library resources, including print materials, electronic resources, and digital materials.
In the following study, we evaluated fourteen major discovery tools (three open source and ten proprietary), benchmarking sixteen criteria recognized as the advanced features of a “next generation catalog.”
The purpose of the study was to evaluate and compare all the major discovery tools , and the findings serve to update librarians on the latest developments and user interfaces and to assist them in their adoption of a discovery tool.
We define a discovery tool as a library user interface independent of any library systems.
A discovery tool should include all library resources in its search including the catalog with books and videos, journal articles in databases, and local archives and digital repository.
Some of the discovery tools are described as web-scale because of their potential to search seamlessly across all library resources.
FINDINGS One Stop searching for all library resources—This is the most desirable feature when acquiring a discovery tool.
The concept of a “Next Generation Catalog” has merged with this idea, and spawned a generation of discovery tools bringing almost Google-like power to library searching.
"Academic Libraries and Discovery Tools: A Survey of the Literature."
This  system-­‐design  perspective  could  offer  a  comparable  baseline  for   discovery  layer  evaluation  across  libraries.  
A  library’s  site  should  not,  by  its  assumptions  about   the  user,  present  obstacles  to  their  search  success.13   With  the  growing  use  of  discovery  systems,14  academic  libraries  are  entering  into  a  new  phase  of   search  engine  deployment.15  By  making  use  of  a  preindexed  database  rather  than  the  more   restrictive  federated  search  process,  the  discovery  service  interface  allows  a  user  to  search  for   content  in  a  wide  variety  of  publication  and  media  types  (e.g.,  journals,  books,  dictionaries,  audio   books,  videos,  manuscripts,  newspapers,  images,  etc.).  
To  that  end,  we  have  committed  to  a  program  that  enhances   discovery  and  delivery  through  the  catalog.  
While  most  libraries  have  built  a  wide  range  of   discovery  tools  into  their  home  pages—adding  links  to  databases  of  electronic  resources,  article   databases,  and  Google  Scholar—we  have  continued  to  enhance  both  the  content  to  be  found  in  the   primary  local  bibliographic  database  and  the  services  available  to  students  and  researchers  via  the   interface  to  the  catalog.  
Indeed,  services  like  ProQuest’s  Summon  or   EBSCO’s  Discovery  Service  might  be  taken  as  another  step  toward  challenging  the  catalog’s   primacy  as  a  discovery  tool  as  they  offered  the  prospect  of  making  local  catalog  records  just  a   fraction  of  a  much  larger  universe  of  bibliographic  information  available  in  a  single,  keyword-­‐ searchable  database.  
First,  discovery  tools  have   broad  implications  for  a  wide  range  of  library  services  and  functions.

INTRODUCTION Index-based discovery systems have become commonplace in academic libraries over the past several years, and academic libraries have invested a great deal of time and money into implementing them.
Frequently, discovery platforms serve as the primary access point to library resources, and in some libraries they have even replaced traditional online public access catalogs.
Because of the prominence of these systems in academic libraries and the important function that they serve, libraries have a vested interest in presenting users with a positive and seamless experience while using a discovery system to find and access library information.
University of Houston Libraries has adopted new discovery technologies as they became available in an effort to provide simplified discovery and access to library resources.
When index-based discovery systems became available, the Libraries saw them as a way to provide an improved and intuitive search experience.
Throughout the implementation of discovery systems in academic libraries, both research studies and anecdotal evidence have suggested that users do not find end-user features like facets valuable; however, discovery system vendors have made no apparent attempt to reimagine the possibilities for search refinements.
In recent years, rapid modernization of online catalogs has brought library discovery to the forefront of research efforts in the library community, giving libraries an opportunity to take a fresh look at such important issues as the scope of the library catalog, metadata creation practices, and the future of library discovery in general.
TERMINOLOGY In this paper, we adopt a broad definition of discovery products as “tools and interfaces that a library implements to provide patrons the ability to search its collections and gain access to materials.
• Discovery layers (also referred to as “discovery interfaces” or “next-generation library catalogs”)—new catalog interfaces, decoupled from the integrated library system and offering enhanced functionality, such as faceted navigation, relevance-ranked results, as well as the ability to incorporate content from institutional repositories and digital libraries.
• Web-scale discovery tools, which in addition to providing all interface features and functionality of next generation catalogs, broaden the scope of discovery by systematically aggregating content from library catalogs, subscription databases, and institutional digital repositories into a central index.
Today’s library discovery tools fall into three categories: online catalogs (the patron interface of the integrated library system (ILS)), discovery layers (a patron interface with enhanced functionality that is separate from an ILS), and web-scale discovery tools (an enhanced patron interface that relies on a central index to bring together resources from the library catalog, subscription databases, and digital repositories).7 These tools are commonly integrated with a variety of external systems, including proxy servers, inter-library loan, subscription databases, individual publisher websites, and more.
