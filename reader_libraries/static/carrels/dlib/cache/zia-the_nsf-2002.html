<p>The National Science Foundation's (NSF) National Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education Digital Library (NSDL) program<sup><font size=-2><a href="11zia.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> recently made its third set of awards for projects in three basic tracks: <em>Collections,</em> <em>Services,</em> and <em>Targeted Research.</em> These projects are working with those funded in fiscal years (FY) 2000 and 2001 to build a national digital library of high quality science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) educational resources for students and teachers at <em>all</em> levels, in both formal and informal settings. By supporting widespread access to a rich, reliable, and authoritative collection of interactive learning and teaching materials and associated services in a digital environment, the National Science Digital Library will encourage and sustain continual improvements in the quality of STEM education for all students, and also serve as a resource for lifelong learning. </p> 

<p>Various workshops and planning meetings during the latter half of the 1990s explored and developed the vision and operational framework for the NSDL program [<a href="11zia.html#1">1-6</a>]. Since the program's formal inception in FY2000, interest has grown steadily  with proposal submissions increasing from 80 in FY2000, to 101 in FY2001, and to 156 in FY2002. In FY2000 thirteen projects were funded in the <em>Collections</em> track, nine in the <em>Services</em> track, and one in the <em>Targeted Research</em> track. In FY2001 eighteen new <em>Collections</em> projects began, along with thirteen in <em>Services,</em> and three in <em>Targeted Research.</em> Brief descriptions of each FY2000 and FY2001 project appear in [<a href="11zia.html#8">8</a>] and [<a href="11zia.html#9">9</a>] respectively; and full abstracts can be found in the Awards section at &lt;<a href="http://www.ehr.nsf.gov/ehr/due/programs/nsdl/">http://www.ehr.nsf.gov/ehr/due/programs/nsdl/</a>&gt;. Two NSF directorates, the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) and the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) have both provided significant co-funding for fifteen projects in these first two fiscal years, illustrating the NSDL program's facilitation of the integration of research and education, an important strategic objective of the NSF.</p> 

<p>For the FY2002 funding cycle, the 156 proposals sought approximately $92 million in total funding. Forty-one new awards have been made with a cumulative budget of approximately $25 million. These include twenty-five in the <em>Collections</em> track, ten in the <em>Services</em> track, and six in the <em>Targeted Research</em> track. As in the first two years of the program, sister directorates to the NSF Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) are providing significant co-funding of projects. Participating directorates include GEO and MPS from before, as well as the Directorate for Biological Sciences.</p> 

<p>Existing projects from FY2000 and FY2001 address subject domains in the life sciences, geosciences, various areas of engineering, the mathematical sciences, and several cross-disciplinary areas. New projects from FY2002 expand this coverage into areas of chemistry and physics. Other new projects focus on collections of video resources, as well as continued work on collections development and services targeting the pre-K to12 educational enterprise. Indeed, nearly half of all existing and new projects in the program have explicit linkages with the pre-K to12 sector or strong secondary efforts in that area. All projects have interdisciplinary teams of principal investigators from a variety of backgrounds, including expertise in the library and information sciences, computer science, digital library research, disciplinary content, and instructional design.</p> 

<p>The past year of the program has also seen the establishment of an information architecture framework for the library resulting from the joint efforts of the NSDL Core Integration project and many of the Collections, Services, and Targeted Research projects. The <em>Core Integration</em> component of NSDL (see &lt;<a href="http://cinews.comm.nsdlib.org/">http://cinews.comm.nsdlib.org/</a>&gt;) provides the organizational and technical infrastructure to bind distributed users of the National Science Digital Library to its distributed collections and services. An NSDL community produced white paper, "Pathways to Progress," [<a href="11zia.html#7">7</a>] informed much of this work and has also stimulated the emergence of a nascent community governance structure that is jointly establishing guidelines, practices, and policies for participation in the larger NSDL building effort. Complete information on technical and organizational progress, including links to current Standing Committees and community workspaces, may be found at the NSDL Communications Portal, see &lt;<a href="http://comm.nsdlib.org/">http://comm.nsdlib.org</a>&gt;. All workspaces are open to the public, and interested organizations and individuals are encouraged to learn more about NSDL and join in its development.</p>

<p>Following is a list of the new FY2002 awards displaying the official NSF award number, the project title, the grantee institution, and the name of the Principal Investigator (PI). A condensed description of the project is also included. Full abstracts are available from the Awards Section at the NSDL program site &lt;<a href="http://www.ehr.nsf.gov/ehr/due/programs/nsdl/">http://www.ehr.nsf.gov/ehr/due/programs/nsdl</a>&gt;. (Grants with shared titles are formal collaborations and are grouped together.) The projects are displayed by track and are listed by award number. In addition, eleven of these projects have explicit relevance to applications to pre-K to12 education (indicated with a * below). Seven others clearly have potential for application to the pre-K to12 arena (indicated with a ** below).</p>

<p>The NSDL program will have another funding cycle in fiscal year 2003 with the next program solicitation expected to be available in January 2003, and an anticipated deadline for proposals in mid-April 2003.</p>

<p>DUE 0226144. <em>Question Triage for Experts and Documents: Expanding the Information Retrieval Function of the NSDL.</em> Institution: University of Massachusetts Amherst. PI: W. Bruce Croft. This project is investigating the merger of the information retrieval (IR) and digital reference components of the National STEM Education Digital Library (NSDL). Combining these functions enables users to find answers to questions regardless if those answers come from documents in NSDL collections or experts accessible through the NSDL's virtual reference desk.</p>
 
<p>DUE 0226216.  <em>ReMarkable Texts: A Digital Notepad for the NSDL.</em> Institution: Brown University. PI: Andy van Dam. Faculty and students are investigating capabilities for an innovative pen-based digital notebook to enable users, particularly students, to work and interact with NSDL's digital materials in a personalized manner. The main features include viewing, taking notes on, annotating (e.g. freehand ink, post-it notes, and bidirectional fine-grained hyperlinks), organizing, and collaborating on multimedia documents, all with the ability to replay the temporal sequence of one's notes in the contexts in which they were made. Whiteboarding and audio facilities are also supported.</p>

<p>DUE 0226217. <em>Integrating Digital Library Resources into Online Courses.</em> Institution: Texas Engineering Experiment Station. PI: Connie McKinzie. This project is investigating a model for integrating content from NSDL into online and web-enhanced courses in higher education, using as a testbed community the students and faculty at the Texas A&amp;M Electronic Teachers College (ETC). Services under investigation include mapping of modular learning object content to teacher certification competencies in high area needs such as mathematics; defining competency-based metadata vocabularies for these learning objects that reflects the teacher certification requirements; and creating a Content-Packaging Tool Suite to enable faculty to select learning objects from a repository, build them into learning modules, and connect them into course-management systems or other delivery platforms.</p>

<p>DUE-0226312. <em>MetaTest: Evaluating the Quality and Utility of Metadata.</em> Institution: Syracuse University. PI: Elizabeth Liddy.  Researchers are evaluating the use and utility of metadata from multiple perspectives. These include the comparison of  the subjective quality of metadata that is assigned both manually and automatically to learning resources; the comparison of the retrieval effectiveness due to metadata that is assigned manually versus automatically to learning resources; determination of searching and browsing behaviors of users when engaged in information seeking in the digital library; and an analysis of the relative contribution of individual elements of the GEM + Dublin Core metadata scheme to users' searching and browsing behavior.</p> 

<p>DUE 0226321. <em>Using Spatial Hypertext as a Workspace for  Digital Library Providers and Patrons.</em> Institution: Texas Engineering Experiment Station. PI: Frank Shipman. This project is investigating the use of spatial hypertext by digital library patrons to build personal and shared annotated digital information spaces, and by digital library providers to organize, annotate, and maintain collections of digital information. Spatial hypertext enables users to collect source materials as information objects in a set of two-dimensional spaces and imply attributes of and relationships between the materials via visual and spatial cues. </p>

<p>DUE 0226483*. <em>Effective Access: Using Digital Libraries to Enhance High School Teaching in STEM.</em> Institution: Education Development Center. PI: Katherine Hanson. This project is studying the use of networked digital resources by secondary school science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teachers as they seek and select quality materials and tailor them to fit the learning environment of their classrooms. Areas of interest include: characterizing the use of digital resources for preparing lessons and for incorporating materials directly into student projects; and investigating types of software tools, lesson templates, and support that enable teachers to integrate digital library resources into general classroom <A name="note1">settings</a>. </p>
