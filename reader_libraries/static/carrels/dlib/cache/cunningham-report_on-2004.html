 <p>One of the more striking features of digital library conferences is the
diversity of the attendees, and ICADL'03 was no exception. The
institutional affiliations of the participants included commercial
organizations, several governmental agencies, museums (including a
representative from the intriguingly named Department of Painting and
Calligraphy of the National Palace Museum of Taiwan), library automation
services, medical libraries, UNESCO, and of course academia&#151;from
departments of computer science, library science, decision science, and
other related fields.  ICADL'03 featured geographic diversity as well,
including presenters from 20 countries.</p> 

 <p>The ICADL'03 conference began with four tutorials, covering knowledge
management systems, management of indigenous knowledge, semantic web
metadata, and a general overview of digital libraries.  From the 136
submissions to the conference, 45 full papers, 23 short papers, and 15
poster papers were accepted.</p> 

 <p>The members of the organizing committee sought to construe the area of
digital libraries as widely as possible:  one member of the committee
stated that, "We are looking at digital libraries in the greater sense&#151;not
just to disseminate knowledge in a conventional manner.  We see digital
libraries as a platform for the political, financial, medical, economic&#151;everything!  Digital libraries are a start for everything."</p> 

 <p>This wide view of the subject area was reflected in the selection of
invited talks:  the conference was opened by Tan Sri Dato' Seri Musa bin
Mohamad, Malaysian Minister of Education, who noted the key role that
rural libraries play in a new Malaysian program to bridge the digital
divide experienced by rural communities, and who highlighted the potential
importance of digital libraries in supporting e-government, commercial
decision making and operational processes, and creation and organization
of indigenous knowledge;  Mr. Bistaman bin Abdal Rahman (Malaysian
Communications and Multimedia Commission) described how the MCMC is
promoting the development of a national broadband plan, so that Malaysians
"will be able to access information at any time, any place, when needed"; 
Datuk Dr. Halime Shafie, Secretary-General of the Malaysian Ministry of
Energy, Communications and Multimedia discussed the infrastructure
necessary to transform Malaysia into a knowledge-based economy and
society;  and Salma Khairuddin (MAMPU) described the implementation status
and future directions of Malaysia's ambitious e-government programme.</p> 

 <p>Invited talks from academia included Professor Ed Fox (Virginia Tech), presenting case
studies from the US National Science Digital Library (NSDL), and particularly
emphasizing the role of digital libraries in creating knowledge, as well
as organizing and storing information; Professor Shalini Urs (University of Mysore), describing
"challenges" (surely an understatement!) encountered when developing multi
institutional, multi language digital libraries, using the Vidyanidhi
Digital Library of Indian theses as a case study; Professor Hsinchun Chen (University of Arizona),
 weaving together his digital libraries and knowledge management
experience to critique current information resources; and Professor Erich
J. Neuhold (Darmstadt University of Technology), discussing personalization facilities in digital libraries,
seeing these facilities as a key to resolving the conflict between
individual-specific information needs and the function of digital
libraries in holistically targeting an entire community of users.</p> 

 <p>According to members of the conference organizing committee, this ICADL's
focus on "indigenous knowledge for global access" was chosen because of
the potential importance of digital libraries in bridging the digital
divide, both within a given country and across cultural borders:  digital
libraries offer a way for minority groups to "create an awareness of
themselves in the infosphere, to make a presence for themselves in that
invisible continent".  It is hoped that digital libraries won't simply
archive indigenous documents, but will become a part of an infrastructure
that supports local cultures, heritage, and values. Committee members also
stressed the importance of indigenous peoples taking charge of their own
digital presence by themselves capturing their knowledge in digital form,
with one benefit being the likelihood of that capture process helping the
indigenous peoples to overcome the digital divide:  "people can identify
with, understand that knowledge&#151;it will be close to them."</p> 

 <p>In accord with this focus, two significant digital libraries were launched
at ICADL:  PERDANA (<a href="http://www.mylib.com.my">http://www.mylib.com.my</a>), a national Malaysian digital
library system emphasizing local digital content in text, images, sound,
and video; and the International Islamic Digital Library (<a href="http://www.iidl.net">http://www.iidl.net</a>), a
portal to multi-language material related to Islam, which also supports a
referral center for inquiries and the exchange of knowledge amongst
scholars of Islam.</p> 

 <p>The paper presentations were organized into 18 parallel sessions, covering
a wide variety of topics.  ICADL has from its inception featured
specifically Asian problems with digital library development, in tailoring
information retrieval algorithms for Asian languages (for example,
"Application of latent semantic indexing on Malay-English cross language
information retrieval"), in processing Asian text or multimedia documents
(for example, "Gradient-based edge detection of Songket motifs"), or in
organizing and delivering collections with an Asian focus (for example,
"Knowledge management in a Chinese genealogy information service").</p> 

 <p>The ICADL'03 organizers included a full social programme for attendees.  The
conference dinner was a sumptuous Aidilfitri feast (marking the end of
Ramadan), accompanied by traditional Malay dancers and numerous lucky
number prize drawings.  An evening city tour included a stop at a craft
market (with members of the local committee keeping an eye on overseas
attendees, to help us bargain effectively) and ended with dinner at a
hawker's food court. On the final day of the conference tours were offered
to CyberJaya, PutraJaya, and the National Library.  CyberJaya and
PutraJaya are developing, planned communities in Malaysia's Multimedia
Super Corridor:  PutraJaya is the new administrative capital of Malaysia,
constructed to take full advantage of the MSC infrastructure to offer
electronic governmental services, and CyberJaya is its twin city in the
MSC, an "intelligent city" designed to incorporate the latest IT
infrastructure in its commercial, municipal, and residential areas, to
attract knowledge industries to the MSC.</p> 

 <p>ICADL 2004, the seventh conference in the ICADL series, will be held in
Shanghai, December 13 - 17.</p>
