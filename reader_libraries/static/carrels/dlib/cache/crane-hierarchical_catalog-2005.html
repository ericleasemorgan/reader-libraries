<H3 class="blue">Abstract</H3>

<p class="blue">
IFLA's Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) lay
the foundation for a new generation of cataloging systems that recognize the
difference between a particular work (e.g., <i>Moby Dick</i>), diverse expressions of
that work (e.g., translations into German, Japanese and other languages),
different versions of the same basic text (e.g., the Modern Library Classics
vs. Penguin editions), and particular items (a copy of <i>Moby Dick</i> on the
shelf). Much work has gone into finding
ways to infer FRBR relationships between existing catalog records and modifying
catalog interfaces to display those relationships. Relatively little work,
however, has gone into exploring the creation of catalog records that are
inherently based on the FRBR hierarchy of works, expressions, manifestations,
and items. The Perseus Digital Library has created a new catalog that
implements such a system for a small collection that includes many works with
multiple versions. We have used this catalog to explore some of the
implications of hierarchical catalog records for searching and browsing.</p>

<H3>1. Introduction</H3>

<p>Current online library catalog interfaces
present many problems for searching.  One
commonly cited failure is the inability to find and collocate all versions of a
distinct intellectual work that exist in a collection and the inability to take
into account known variations in titles and personal names (<a href="10crane.html#Yee">Yee</a> 2005). The IFLA
Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) attempts to address
some of these failings by introducing the concept of multiple interrelated
bibliographic entities (<a href="10crane.html#IFLA">IFLA</a> 1998). In
particular, relationships between abstract intellectual works and the various
published instances of those works are divided into a four-level hierarchy of
works (such as the <i>Aeneid</i>), expressions (Robert Fitzgerald's translation of the
<i>Aeneid</i>), manifestations (a particular paperback edition of Robert Fitzgerald's
translation of the <i>Aeneid</i>), and items (my copy of a particular paperback
edition of Robert Fitzgerald's translation of the <i>Aeneid</i>). In this formulation,
each level in the hierarchy &quot;inherits&quot; information from the preceding
level.</p>

<p>Much of the work on FRBRized catalogs so
far has focused on organizing existing records that describe individual
physical books. Relatively little work has gone into rethinking what
information should be in catalog records, or how the records should relate to
each other. It is clear, however, that a more &quot;native&quot; FRBR catalog
would include separate records for works, expressions, manifestations, and
items. In this way, all information about a work would be centralized in one
record. Records for subsequent expressions of that work would add only the
information specific to each expression: Samuel Butler's translation of the
<i>Iliad</i> does not need to repeat the fact that the work was written by Homer. This
approach has certain inherent advantages for collections with many versions of
the same works: new publications can be cataloged more quickly, and records can
be stored and updated more efficiently.</p>

<H3>2. FRBR Implementations</H3>

<p>One recent survey of FRBR implementations
by Martha Yee has described some of the common problems users have with library
catalog systems and ways that a FRBR organization can address those problems
(<a href="10crane.html#Yee">Yee</a> 2005). First, she finds that it is often difficult to search for author
and title combinations because variant name information is isolated in
authority records. Second, she finds that catalogs are often poor at displaying
the full range of relevant materials that the library holds because of
variations in titles. Yee then describes how both problems can be addressed by
making the catalog more aware of connections between author information and
work information and between different versions of the same work.</p>

<p>A great deal of research has examined how
the implementation of FRBR might affect online public access catalogs (OPAC).
In recent years, OCLC has launched a number of FRBR related research projects.
After conducting a number of experiments with WorldCat records, OCLC
researchers concluded that the algorithmic identification of expressions is
quite difficult and decided to focus their research on the identification of
works instead (<a href="10crane.html#Hickey">Hickey</a> 2002). Other OCLC projects have included the creation of
an open source FRBR Work-set algorithm that converts MARC21 bibliographic
databases to a FRBR model (<a href="10crane.html#FRBR-Work">FRBR Work-set Algorithm</a> 2005) and the development of
the FictionFinder catalog, a FRBR prototype system for searching and browsing
bibliographic records for fictional works (FictionFinder 2005). Searches in the
FictionFinder system return a list works, rather than a list of individual
bibliographic records. Selecting a particular work leads to a list of
expressions of that work, and choosing an individual expression leads to a list
of manifestations. In early 2005, OCLC announced a new project entitled
CURIOSER that will seek to make open WorldCat more useful and will integrate
previous OCLC FRBR research in order to support display and navigation of
records in a FRBR context (<a href="10crane.html#CURIOSER">CURIOSER</a> 2005).</p>

<p>Similarly, the Research Libraries Group
has created RedLightGreen, an online catalog designed specifically for
undergraduates that utilizes the FRBR model while not yet serving as a full
FRBR implementation (<a href="10crane.html#RedLightGreen">RedLightGreen</a> 2005). Merilee Proffitt of RLG has described
this prototype as a FRBRish not FRBRized catalog that has utilized many of the
intellectual concepts behind FRBR in its design. System designers found that
the FRBR Group 1 entities of work, expression, manifestation and item were
important during the conceptual modeling stages and have used these concepts to
determine how records should cluster in their catalog (<a href="10crane.html#Proffitt">Proffitt</a> 2004). </p>

<p>FRBR has also been implemented in the
Australian Literature Gateway (AustLit) with some modifications and extensions
to the basic model. AustLit augmented the FRBR model with INDECS event modeling
in their digital gateway to Australian literature. In their model, works have a
creation event, expressions have a realization event, and manifestations have
an embodiment event (<a href="10crane.html#Ayres-2003">Ayres</a> 2003). Their modeling also introduced the concept of
the Super Work. They found that there were a number of issues in converting the
data to the FRBR model, of particular concern was the fact that the FRBR model
has a whole monograph emphasis and most of their records were non-monograph
items such as individual poems or reviews (<a href="10crane.html#Ayres-2004">Ayres</a> 2004). Nonetheless, they were
able to develop a number of automated processes to convert records to the FRBR
format, and developed a maintenance interface to support human intervention
with problematic records. The hardest challenge for catalogers was in
distinguishing between new expressions and manifestations of works. In
designing their user interface, they chose to use light visual clues like dot
points and simple text statements such as &quot;this work has appeared in x
different versions&quot; to guide the user. During evaluation they found that
users seemed to have no difficulty in navigating the interface (<a href="10crane.html#Ayres-2004">Ayers</a> 2004). </p>

<p>Some FRBR research has involved the
creation of tools for experimenting with the model, rather than full
implementation of FRBR catalogs. The Library of Congress has created a FRBR
display tool that takes flat files of MARC records and uses XSLT to transform
this data into meaningful displays by grouping the bibliographic data into the
&quot;Work,&quot; &quot;Expression&quot; and &quot;Manifestation&quot; FRBR
entities (<a href="10crane.html#FRBR-Display">FRBR Display Tool</a> 2004). The tool is largely intended to display FRBR
on the fly for libraries wishing to experiment with the model (<a href="10crane.html#Radebaugh">Radebaugh</a> 2004).
Roberto Sturman, a librarian at the University of Trieste has also developed an experimental FRBR tool called
IFPA (ISIS FRBR Prototype Application) that can be viewed on the
Web (<a href="10crane.html#IFPA">IFPA</a> 2005). This software serves as an application for the UNESCO ISIS retrieval software and was developed to manage the data and
relationships implied in the FRBR model. Sturman stresses that his tool is
meant to serve as an academic experiment that will assist people interested in
experimenting with the FRBR model (<a href="10crane.html#Sturman">Sturman</a> 2004).</p>

<p>Several commercial vendors have also
designed FRBR implementations. The Virtua catalog developed by VTLS Inc. is
marketed as offering full support of the FRBR Model (<a href="10crane.html#Virtua">Virtua</a> 2005), while Portia
has created VisualCat, an integrated cataloging system that is capable of
consolidating different types of metadata within a single semantic framework
based on RDF and FRBR (<a href="10crane.html#VisualCat">VisualCat</a> 2005).
</p>
<H3>3. The Perseus
Digital Library</H3>

<p>We felt that the Perseus Digital Library (PDL)
would be an ideal testbed for research on FRBR-based records and catalog
interfaces for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is moderately
sized. Although the digital content of the PDL is substantial, the number of
bibliographic entities is moderate: on the order of one or two thousand
distinct intellectual works rather than the millions in catalogs like WorldCat.
This scale makes it possible for staff to give individual, personal attention
as necessary to each bibliographic record within a reasonable time period.</li>

<li class="spacetop">It is highly
structured. The core of the PDL is a collection of literary documents from the
Greco-Roman period. Almost all of the ancient works, such as Homer's <i>Iliad</i>, are
present in the collection in multiple versions, for example the original text
in Greek along with one or more English translations. Additionally, the
collection contains many works that have fundamental relationships to other
works, such as a commentary on a particular book of the <i>Iliad</i> or a lexicon
specific to Homer.</li>

<li class="spacetop">It is already
well cataloged. Most of the digital works in the PDL are derived from scanned
print editions that are present in WorldCat or LC Voyager. Although many of the
catalog records for our out-of-copyright editions are not consistent with
modern cataloging practice, we do have some level of professional catalog data
for the great majority of the collection. This provides a strong starting
point. Additionally, we are in the unusual position of already having unique,
authorized identifiers for many of our distinct intellectual works because of
the Thesaurus Linguae Grecae canon, which assigns numbers to all attested Greek
authors and their works. A similar scheme exists for Latin, developed by the
Packard Humanities Institute.</li>

<li class="spacetop">It is entirely
digital. As a result, our catalog does not need to keep track of any sort of
circulation information. Additionally, our digital document interface provides
virtually no interesting item-level metadata. This may change if we are able to
expand the number of documents that are available in different formats, such as
HTML, XML, and PDF, but at the moment there is little point in cataloging our
collection beyond the manifestation level. Dealing with a three-level hierarchy
rather than a four-level hierarchy simplifies the system somewhat, but adding
item information would make little difference.</li></ul>

<H3>4. Building a
Hierarchical Catalog</H3>

<p>The format we chose to express our
metadata was a combination of the MODS (Metadata Object Description Schema) and MADS (Metadata Authority Description Schema) standards. As was previously
argued by Karen Coyle (<a href="10crane.html#Coyle">Coyle</a> 2004), we felt that incrementally improving the
MARC record would not be a productive direction. Compared to newer XML-based
formats, the infrastructural overhead of parsing, searching, and displaying
MARC records was too great to make a MARC-based approach feasible. Another
important feature of the MODS/MADS family is that it includes the extremely
flexible &lt;relatedItem&gt; field, which was explicitly designed to express a
wide variety of relationships between catalog entities.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="vergil-rev.jpg" width="540" height="389" alt="Screen shot from the Perseus Catalog"><br><br><b>A screenshot of the Perseus hierarchical catalog</b></p>

<p>The starting point for our catalog was a
set of MODS catalog records downloaded directly from the Library of Congress
through the Voyager SRU service and manually
created from OCLC WorldCat catalog data. The Perseus Digital Library has for
many years maintained links between TLG identifiers for canonical works and the
documents in the collection that are instances of those works (<a href="10crane.html#Mahoney">Mahoney</a> 2000).
These two databases were sufficient to generate the hierarchical catalog.</p>

<p>Our work-level records are MADS records,
extending the notion of the work as an authorized entity. The two remaining
levels are implemented as MODS records. Although this distinction makes sense
bibliographically, it did present difficulties in implementation, as all XPath
queries against the database had to be formulated both in the MODS namespace
and the MADS namespace.</p>

<p>The last step in the process was to divide
information currently in individual records into multiple hierarchical records.
For single-manifestation works, this was simply a matter of passing the record
through three different XSL filters. The division of metadata fields between
FRBR levels is based on a proposal by Sally McCallum. (<a href="10crane.html#McCallum">McCallum</a> 2004). For works with more than one manifestation
(largely primary texts in the Classics collection), the work-level records were
generated separately from an existing bibliographic database at Perseus,
independently from the LC MODS records. The distribution of MODS fields was as
follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>At the work level, we have placed metadata
fields that are common to all versions of a work. These include the author name
and the uniform title, which specifies a single authorized title for works that
have many editions, each potentially with a different title. As with a standard
authority record, the work record also provides a good place to specify common
variants of the title. This factor is especially important in a collection with
many multilingual materials: a student assigned to find  Cicero's <i>Catilinarian</i> orations may not know to look under
the Latin title <i>In Catilinam</i>. Additionally, we have placed subject,
classification, and genre information at the work level.</li>

<li class="spacetop">At the expression level, we have included
language, editor, translator, abstract, and table of contents fields. This
level tends to be the sparsest in our collections, although this is to some
extent based on the fact that the Library of Congress MODS records on which we
based our catalog did not distinguish between authors, editors, and
translators: only the MARC role &quot;creator&quot; was provided.</li>

<li class="spacetop">Finally, at the manifestation level we
have included the publication's actual title, publication information, physical
description information, and any notes. This level also includes any related
item information that is not directly related to the FRBR hierarchy, such as
membership in a series.</li></ul>

<H3>5. Hierarchical
Records and Analytical Cataloging</H3>

<p>Bringing more focus to the hierarchical
relationships between intellectual works and their manifestations in our
documents has also brought part-whole relationships into more prominence. Very
often, manifestations of shorter works are found in our collection as part of
larger volumes, for example collections of speeches by minor Attic orators or
the complete works of Aeschylus. These relationships raise interesting
questions. At the work level, one play by Aeschylus is clearly a distinct
entity from another play, but at the manifestation level, the publication
information for every translated play in the volume is the same, and therefore
should be kept in a single record.</p>

<p>Our current implementation addresses this
problem by linking a single manifestation-level record for the multi-work
volume to multiple expression-level works. This compromise works for our
collection, but we cannot be certain that it will scale to larger collections,
especially those for which analytical catalog data is not currently available.</p>

<H3>6. Searching a
Hierarchical Catalog</H3>

<p>Although a hierarchical catalog has many
obvious advantages for searching and browsing, it presents some new challenges
in implementation. With ordinary MARC records, searching a catalog has been
fairly simple. A set of query terms is matched against a set of records,
returning the subset of records that contain some or all of the search terms.
In contrast, searches against hierarchical catalogs can become extremely
complex. A single search might contain terms that occur at several different
levels. For example, a search for &quot;Butler AND <i>Iliad</i>&quot; would need to match an
expression-level element (translator) and a work-level element (uniform title).
Even when matching records are located, they may not contain complete
information: in the previous example, the system would still need to request
one or more manifestation-level records. The system may also want to expand
search results to include other expressions and manifestations of a matched
work. Finally, de-duplication becomes an important problem. If both the work
record and a manifestation record match the query (such as &quot;<i>Iliad</i>&quot; in
the title and the uniform title) the system needs to know not to expand the
records in both directions.</p>

<p>None of these problems are directly
addressed by current XML databases. In order to create a catalog that displayed
the unique, complete results returned by arbitrary queries in hierarchical
format, we would have needed to implement complex matching algorithms and slow,
recursive record expansion algorithms. Initial experiments with simple queries
showed noticeable performance problems.</p>

<p>The simplest solution we have found for
the problems outlined above is to keep two parallel versions of the catalog,
both containing the same records. The first is simply a collection of
individual records, one for each work, expression, and manifestation. The
second is a set of &quot;composite&quot; records, one for each work, that bring
together in one XML tree all of the expressions of the work and all of the
manifestations of each of those expressions. The first set are the editable
copies. To draw an analogy to computer programming, they are the &quot;source
code&quot;. The second set is the &quot;compiled&quot; version, optimized for
searching. By creating composite records, we essentially reduce the problem of
searching the hierarchical catalog to the earlier problem of searching a
&quot;flat&quot; catalog: the search engine, in our case an XML database, is
simply asked to return the records that match a query. The display code, an XSL
stylesheet, can then choose whether or not to display unmatched elements of the
composite record (e.g. versions of the <i>Iliad</i> not translated by Butler), and how to highlight the terms that matched the
query.</p>

<p>In our experiment, we used custom tags
(&lt;work&gt;, &lt;expression&gt;, &lt;manifestation&gt;) as a framework for
the hierarchical structure of the composite records. In order for catalogs of
this nature to be accessible through federated searching systems such as SRU/W,
the library community must standardize on a means for specifying relationships
between blocks of XML. This could include some form of METS or RDF XML.</p>

<H3>7. Conclusions</H3>

<p>Our work has shown that small,
theoretically well-founded changes in the structure of catalog records,
combined with readily available database software can produce catalog
interfaces that address previously identified problems with existing library
catalog interfaces.</p>

<h4>The Need for New
Identifiers</H4>

<p>One aspect that this work has highlighted
is the need for unique identifiers at every hierarchical level. This need has
been previously identified by Karen Coyle (<a href="10crane.html#Coyle">Coyle</a> 2004). Identifiers provide the
&quot;glue&quot; that holds distributed records together. Currently, most
standard identifiers (OCLC accession numbers, ISBNs, LCCNs) are issued at the
manifestation level. Work-level identifiers exist in narrow domains, such as
the TLG for works in Greek and uniform titles for works with many cataloged
versions. Even these sources are problematic. Catalogers may not be aware of
special-purpose schemes such as the TLG. Uniform titles, which are designed to
be read by humans, are inefficient and unwieldy for computational use. As
Kristin Antelman points out, &quot;Documents do not need to be described to be
referenced in a networked world; they must be identified. An inherently
descriptive element, such as title, cannot meet the requirements of a network
identifier.&quot; (<a href="10crane.html#Antelman">Antelman</a> 2004)</p>

<p>Creating new identifiers for work- and
expression-level entities is a reasonable goal within a short period of time. The technology of identifiers is already well studied. Several high 
quality systems for creating identifiers have been implemented. These 
systems are not, however, currently being applied to more abstract 
bibliographic entities. The creation of work-level identifiers is a 
question of deterimining the correct authorities for issuing the 
identifiers and reliable methodologies for distinguishing works, not one 
of actually producing the identifiers themselves. 
At a recent workshop at OCLC on issues related to FRBR, Ketil Albertsen
(<a href="10crane.html#Albertsen">Albertsen</a> 2005) outlined a number of the attributes of a successful
identification scheme and Patrick Le Boeuf (<a href="10crane.html#Le-Bouef">Le Bouef</a> 2005) described systems that could potentially fill some of
the requirements.</p>

<p>Deciding a new system of identifiers and
issuing authorized numbers for works is a role that small libraries like
Perseus cannot fulfill. In order for distributed hierarchical catalogs to become
useful, there must be a network of widely known naming authorities, such as
national libraries, that can assign unique identifiers to all cataloged
intellectual works and expressions.</p>

<H4>Benefits</H4>

<p>Moving to a hierarchical catalog would
involve a substantial investment in time, money, and technology. The end
result, however, is a higher quality catalog that can be more easily
maintained, distributed, and searched.</p>

<p>The hierarchical MODS/MADS catalog
effectively separates FRBR levels into manageable segments. These segments in
turn provide easily updatable and reusable building blocks for further
cataloging and networked catalog reuse. When we add a new translation of Livy's
history of Rome to our library, we only need to locate the standard
identifier for the work and specify it along with a small amount of publication
information.</p>

<p>The benefits for library users are also
clear. The composite records described in this article automatically organize
complex works with many manifestations into a simple, understandable format.
Searching for a title and author combination brings up an interface that
displays all available versions, even those that would not by themselves match
the query. These records can also integrate work-level authority data such as
alternate titles into the searchable record. As a result, searching the catalog
becomes dramatically more powerful while at the same time retaining simplicity
and efficiency in implementation.</p>
