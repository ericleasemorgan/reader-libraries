<p><P>The surge in dot com funding has brought us commercial ventures 
such as netLibrary [<A 
HREF="01crane.html#ref1">1</A>], ebrary 
<A HREF="01crane.html#ref2">2</A>], and Questia 
[<A HREF="01crane.html#ref3">3</A>], which are 
creating electronic libraries with collections that include tens of 
thousands of books. And they are growing fast: although modest by the 
standards of print collections, these commercial digital libraries 
already dwarf even the largest non-profit collections. </P>

<P>Whatever their technical strategies, these enterprises provide at 
least one enormous service.  They make available in electronic form 
materials that are protected by copyright and controlled by 
publishers who depend upon sales revenues.  The challenge is 
enormous:  these new digital libraries must negotiate agreements for 
tens of thousands of books and then convert these materials into a 
useful electronic format.  Nevertheless, developing a good business 
plan and building the library &#150; challenging as those tasks may 
be &#150; may prove to be the easy part.  Developing a productive 
relationship with higher education requires more.</P>

<P>First, academics have grown wary of commercial publishers.  Many 
feel that the chain from author to audience has already grown too 
long and expensive.  The appearance of new for-profit digital 
libraries means that the consumers of information will be asked to 
support yet another organization (with its accompanying salaries and 
investors). Universities are more complex than publishing houses, and 
much as they could use extra revenue, it is by no means clear that it 
is in the interest of universities to mortgage their intellectual 
property to subscription services.  The better a university, the less 
dependent it is upon income streams such as tuition: big universities 
derive their fundamental strength from augmenting their endowments 
and attracting research funds.  Nevertheless, the ultimate source of 
their strength is prestige.  Prestige draws gifts and grants.  The 
prestige of academia as a whole strengthens the social contract 
between higher education and society.  In cases where the 
social contract is clear and popular, the results are tremendous: 
projects such as the Human Genome Project and agencies such as NIH 
flourish because the American people understand that such research 
may help them live longer, healthier lives.  By contrast, the National Endownment for the Humanities (NEH) was almost eliminated and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) permanently crippled in 1995 because 
the population felt (and not without some justification) that 
humanists and artists largely disdained the general public. The 
near-death experience forced the NEH and (at least some) 
humanists to begin rethinking the relationship of their work to 
society. The strategic mission of institutions 
individually, and of higher education as a whole, is to reestablish 
public prestige by demonstrating that they are contributing to 
society.  To achieve this goal, the broader the audience is, the better. 
</P>

<P>The implications for the new commercial digital libraries are 
substantial.  Publishers need an income stream; universities and 
academics, while happy to have income, fundamentally need exposure. 
As a rule of thumb, anything published in university presses is 
written for prestige.  Economic pressures have forced university 
presses to worry more about print runs, but this pressure has, I 
believe, lessened our ability to communicate complex arguments to our 
colleagues.  Insofar as the new commercial digital libraries increase 
exposure, they advance the interests of higher education. </P>

<P>Every new entrant into the commercial market needs to reflect on 
the problem of who owns scholarly output. Universities, in my 
experience, are less interested in owning their faculty's work 
than in making sure the faculty assign only non-exclusive rights. 
Although publishers hold exclusive rights to most content, that model 
has provoked  widespread dissatisfaction. In the print world, where 
libraries build up permanent collections of inexpensive books, 
copyright is not viewed as a problem: the physical reproduction of 
print has been so expensive that it is simpler to buy books from a 
publisher.  In the electronic world, however, the marginal cost of 
additional copies is essentially zero; when (some) print publishers 
use their monopolistic positions to drive up prices and create 
mechanisms that protect copyright by restricting the spread of 
information, many academics question the tradition whereby faculty 
transfer exclusive rights to publishers.  </P>

<P>If push comes to shove, universities have a very strong case that 
they contribute the overwhelming majority of resources to scholarly 
publication.  Consider this rough &#150; and very conservative &#150; 
estimate: Assume that it takes two years of labor to produce a solid 
academic book (this is conservative as it assumes a professor 
publishes a major book every six years, working part time during the 
academic year, full time in the summer and full time during a six 
month sabbatical).  Even paying a minimal salary 
($40,000/year before benefits), the university has invested at least 
$100,000 in that book.  How much money does the publisher really 
invest with editorial advice and even modern copyediting (i.e., 
stylistic editing and intensive XML tagging)? Note that many of the 
most prestigious book series are edited by professors.  Faculty 
advisors do the work for free or for a pittance because of the 
immense power and patronage they receive.  The money people at 
universities can do the math also.  Universities end up paying for the editing 
through their library acquisitions budgets.  They are perfectly 
capable of reallocating that money so that they do the editing 
themselves and publish the books electronically. </P>

<P>Consider another figure.  If 25,000 of the books in the original 
release for a commercial digital library, for example, are university 
press books or written by professors, then you are looking at a $2.5 
billion investment of academic labor.  Huge as a commercial digital 
library&#146;s investment may be, it is at least an order of magnitude 
smaller than the investment made by the university community.  When 
we consider the cost of creating content, a strong case can be made 
that any commercial entity adds only a drop of value to the immense 
pool of knowledge fed and funded by academia.  </P>

<P>Already, projects such as the Open Archive Initiative, the 
American Memory Project at the Library of Congress, the Perseus 
Digital Library, and others make their data freely available.  These 
may or may not be the wave of the future, but the new commercial 
digital libraries need to decide how (and whether) they can survive 
if such projects do become the rule.  What happens if all the data is 
made freely available and all the core software is available under 
open source licenses?  Can they make money?</P>

<P>I suspect that they can.  The academic world invests a substantial 
amount of money, through both individual and library purchases, to aquire third party information.  The new digital library companies 
have an opportunity to explore new models of partnership with higher 
education &#150; the current economic and social structures certainly 
seem problematic.  I do not know what those new models should be, but 
I offer as a kind of "open letter" to commercial digital libraries 
the following ideas for ways they might pursue productive 
relationships with higher education: </P>
<p>
<UL>
<LI>&quot;Dot coms&quot; must recognize that they are commercial 
firms and that they will be viewed as such.  Always start by making it clear 
that you need to make money, even if you go on to stress the public 
benefit you hope to provide.</LI></UL>

<UL><LI>Academics are clannish and pay close attention to who starts and 
who runs a company. Corporate web sites that present a team of managers 
with few academics may attract investors but can alienate academics. 
Many times I have heard librarians and administrators remark that 
they really don't want to work with commercial firms if they can help 
it; if, however, a web company was founded by an academic, they take 
a second and much more positive look at that company. </LI></UL>

<UL><LI>Academics in general and humanists in particular are also 
professional cynics. They may make short-term deals based on your firm's 
current management team, but no responsible leader will establish a 
long-term relationship with you based on what she thinks of the 
current management team or of your personal ideals. Everyone has to 
assume that, if a start-up company is profitable, it will be acquired 
by a larger commercial concern; for this reason, no one can give any 
commercial digital library the benefit of the doubt on any long-term 
deal or assume that it won&#146;t exercise the full power of its 
market position as ruthlessly as possible.</LI></UL>

<UL><LI>Make it a public policy that your company seeks only non-exclusive rights. Academics want a &quot;second source&quot; to 
information.  They have had plenty of experience with monopoly 
capitalism, and while they may accept your position as a necessary 
evil, in their 
eyes, you will be just another publisher out to make a buck. Your power will be the aggregate of materials and services that 
you provide.  You may get market advantage from exclusive deals, but taking the high road of non-exclusivity will net 
you more in the long run.</LI></UL>

<UL><LI>Entering large numbers of books is "the easy part."   The real 
issue is how to help people improve the questions they can ask. 
Giving scholars an on-line research library -- an electronic 
environment where all the books were on-line and all the citations 
had been converted into active links -- would be an important first 
step, but still only a first step. The hard part comes  
developing the tools people really need.  Such tools tend to be 
domain specific and often are not obvious.  Some commercial 
systems are beautifully organized to perform the staggering job of 
converting and delivering hundreds of thousands of books, but I am 
not sure whether any are really designed to reach the next level.</LI></UL>

<UL><LI>In  structuring data, avoid proprietary formats.  Use of 
proprietary structures will provoke resentment and resignation at the 
best, public outrage at the worst.  Academics love open standards 
&#150; that's one reason why UNIX has flourished in universities. 
Publish your format.  Make it possible for other people to create 
documents that conform to your service without your having to do the 
data conversion.  If you have a brilliant new Document Type Definition (DTD) that lets you add 
new services, for example, the XML community will figure out what the 
underlying data structure is anyway.  It may be that your tags will 
only bear fruit in the future (that's a situation we know very well, 
having worked with SGML for almost fifteen years) but the ill-will 
caused by a proprietary DTD could really damage your standing.  Many 
academics love Adobe, for example, because Postscript is a public 
standard and because Adobe is pushing other open standards (such as 
SVG).</LI></UL>

<UL><LI>Learn from the Genome debate.  There is an emerging consensus 
about how to balance public good and private interest, allowing people to patent 
some things but making sure that enough information is in the public 
domain to help push science and industry.  The analogue in the 
humanities would be the following: &quot;the primary sources are 
free; copyright protects the secondary sources &#150; with the notes 
and interpretation.&quot;</LI></UL>

<UL><LI>Make a sharp distinction between public domain data and the 
copyrighted data you license.  Allocate 10% of your data 
conversion program to public domain materials and give the XML source 
texts out freely under something like a GNU Public License (GPL) 
&#150; meaning that you have to get credit and any modifications 
people make must be freely distributed. Academics love things like 
open source.  The more you can do with something like the GPL, the 
more people will trust you and the more you will dramatize the fact 
that you aren't just another publisher. One member of a commercial 
digital library firm mentioned with justified disgust that one 
publisher wanted royalties for its reprint of <I>Moby Dick.</I>  Lots 
of people have had the same experience &#150; use the short 
sightedness of the publishers to strengthen your own company. If you 
start with 90% protected and 10% fully open materials, you still have 
a huge added value to sell.  And you get the advantage that people 
(who unreasonably want everything for free) will direct their 
resentment against the publishers and not your company. Every 
person who uses the public domain sources will see your company's 
name and URL.  Banner ads may not prove effective for many companies, 
but discrete "PBS style" sponsorship links may be ideal for new 
commercial firms seeking credibility as well as exposure. Imagine the 
press that you would receive if you were able to "tithe" your data 
conversion.  "Questia/Netlibrary/Ebrary, etc. presents the Library of 
Congress with 5,000 key source texts for literature and history, with 
promises of 20,000 more in the coming two years."</LI></UL>

<UL><LI>Make tagged sources available. However much money you invest, you 
can't possibly pay for the kind of careful tagging and editing that 
many complex sources really require.  Such "level 5" tagging (to use 
an LC taxonomy) requires knowledge of the source materials and the 
subject.  Even with clever software, this sort of editing is very 
laborious.  But this sort of editing is exactly what scholars have 
traditionally done.  There is a growing number of young academics who 
combine domain knowledge and technical expertise &#150; let them do the hard 
work and let them validate the documents (another reason to publish 
your formats!). Make <I>fully </I>tagged sources available, however,  
individuals are going to be less likely to add value to your e-texts 
if they know they are putting back elaborate tags that you have 
stripped out.</LI></UL>

<UL><LI>In general, look for places where you can help institutions as 
well as students.  A lot of the most expensive tasks that drive up overhead and eat up budgets could, in a world of fast 
networks, be outsourced.  Library functions are only one example.</LI></UL>

<UL><LI>Your investment in technical infrastructure is very important. 
Even in the most radical open source community, people accept the 
notion of paying for better service.  The Perseus Digital Library, 
for example, has many strengths but we are outgrowing our 
infrastructure.  Thus far, we have been able to add capacity in tiny ($5-10K) 
increments.  The next jump probably reflects a $500K investment. 
Furthermore, a free site such as ours cannot guarantee 7*24 service. 
People use the site at their own risk with no guarantees.</LI></UL>

<UL><LI>Provide access to expert librarians.  My own institution, for 
example, is a major university, but we have only one humanities 
librarian.  It is impossible for him to keep abreast of everything 
going on in the humanities.  If I want to find out if there are 
microfilms of nineteenth century British newspapers, he is not much 
better placed to answer this question than I am.  If I had access to 
a librarian specializing in 19<SUP>th</SUP> century British history 
and literature, the answer would be authoritative and fast in coming. 
Collect a group of domain experts to provide authoritative 
information.  They could do so by e-mail and phone;  perhaps better 
still might be having queries be public so that everyone could see 
the questions and answers.  You can collect domain experts very 
quickly and immediately provide a service far more expert than all 
but the strongest schools have.   Thus, even before you have the  
on-line books, you can have on-line reference librarians to level 
the playing field between the small schools and the great 
universities.</LI></UL>

<UL><LI>If you have particular expertise at structuring information, 
offer this as a service.  Projects such as mine can get basic XML 
tagging from India and China, but the important work &#150; the 
structure that really adds value to the document &#150; has to be 
done in-house.  Real tagging (like cataloguing) requires serious 
expertise and (for now at least) benefits greatly from an investment in 
customized software tools.  OCLC has done pretty well selling 
catalogue records.  Creating XML is even harder.  The key is being 
able to draw on expertise not available in a data entry firm 
off-shore.  I know how much we pay for outsourcing my data entry. 
You ought to be able to get great rates given your volume.  Why not 
turn this into a profit center?  My university, for example, is 
developing the infrastructure to convert its publications into high 
quality XML.  You could probably do this more efficiently than we 
could in-house.  Even after you have entered every back list book you 
want, you will have plenty of documents coming through. This industry 
plays to the insecurities and aspirations of the universities.  They 
want to own the data.  Let them own it.  Come to us and we will 
structure your documents for you.  You can then put them up on your 
own sites.  We will, however, also offer added value services 
that people can pay for &#150; and, if we do the work, then we 
guarantee that the data will derive the maximum benefit from our 
system.  If someone else can do better with their software, more 
power to them. Ultimately, publishers may have to go this route 
anyway.  Why not get there first?  And helping universities maintain 
non-exclusive rights to their intellectual property would make you 
heroes in many circles.</LI>
