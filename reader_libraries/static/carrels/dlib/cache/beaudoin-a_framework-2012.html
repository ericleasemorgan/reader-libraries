<h3 class="blue">Abstract</h3>

<p class="blue">The quality and the quantity of contextual information found in the descriptive metadata associated with digital representations of cultural objects are frequently inadequate for assuring that users will understand the nature of both the original object that has been digitally preserved, and the digital representation itself. This paper proposes and defines a framework for ensuring that relevant contextual metadata is easily collected and maintained. After identifying and describing eight important dimensions of context, the paper shows how implementing the framework, through a series of questions and prompts, results in a descriptive metadata record that accommodates the important aspects of an object's context. Using two very different cultural objects as examples, an Etruscan tomb painting and a 19th century bridge, the framework demonstrates that sufficient contextual information can be recorded in a metadata schema to enable effective future search, retrieval, examination, use, management, and preservation interactions.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Understanding as much about the context of an object as possible, such as it's history, composition, purpose, authenticity, ownership and utility, is critical to a meaningful understanding of that object. This holds true for appreciating all types of cultural objects &#151; a work of art, a sound recording, a monument of historic significance, or a digital photograph of that historic monument. Unfortunately, the metadata captured during digital preservation that is necessary for providing a good understanding of an object is often fragmentary and incomplete. In an effort to remedy this situation, this paper identifies the kind of information that needs to be captured and presents a framework for recording this metadata. Digital surrogates of cultural objects were chosen as the focus of this project as they are primarily non-textual in nature, and so the contextual information recorded about these items is particularly important. </p>

<p>An analysis of the various kinds of context found in the digital preservation literature was undertaken to develop the framework presented below. This literature review, also published in <i>D-Lib Magazine</i><sup><a href="11beaudoin2.html#n1">1</a></sup>, served to identify and investigate the various forms of context believed to be useful in digital preservation efforts surrounding cultural objects.  The main themes found in the literature were then used to develop the basic dimensions of the framework. Each dimension speaks to an aspect of context distinct from the others and suggests the richness of the data that needs to be recorded. As each dimension of the framework encompasses a specific set of qualities, definitions of the dimensions would be highly useful here.</p>

<div class="divider-full">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Definitions of the Dimensions of Context</h3>

<p>Broadly speaking, the <b>technical</b> dimension surrounding context concerns digitization processes and techniques. This includes aspects such as file formats, hardware, software, operating systems, migration, emulation, storage, data loss, encapsulation of technical information, and compatibility issues. It identifies the processes completed, the individual(s) who performed the work, and the dates when the work was completed. Furthermore, this dimension includes information about the various versions of files, file names and storage locations, the software used, and the equipment upon which the work is to be displayed.</p>
	
<p>The next dimension, readily recognizable as critical to understanding an item's contextual information, is <b>utilization</b>. This dimension of context speaks to the needs of users. It includes audience needs, task support, tools required for interactions with the item, accessibility, audience characteristics, and the types of analyses to be supported. Additional issues described within this dimension concern the use setting of the original and the digital item. This includes the political, social, and organizational environment of its use, and details about the digital content's accessibility and persistence over time.</p>
	
<p>Those characteristics of a work that are dependent upon a direct, tangible interaction with items are addressed in the <b>physical</b> dimension of context. This includes features of analog and digital items which are sensory in nature. Issues relating to how an object is experienced (e.g., scale, materials, texture, arrangement, sound, brightness, smell, etc.) are recorded within this dimension. As the material nature of an item is changed in the analog to digital transformation, and also in the mediated interactions which result from the software and hardware used, the details recorded here can be critical to understanding the original object. </p>
	
<p>Other aspects lost in the analog to digital transition have to do with determining an item's extent, how the parts of a single item, or several items, are related to one another, impermanent relationships between digital content, the various paths that can be taken through an object, and network linkages between items. Based on the unclear boundaries and the sometimes mutable relationships which exist with digital items, this dimension of context is named <b>intangible</b>. </p>
	
<p>Another dimension to be identified as useful to contextual information concerns the reasons why a digital item is preserved and identifies specific decisions about its preservation, storage and handling. This dimension, <b>curatorial</b>, identifies the individual(s) who requested that an item be preserved, and provides background information concerning the motivation for preservation efforts. Also recorded within this dimension is information concerning additional files representing the same object and/or the same digital item. This information is useful in making informed decisions about the uniqueness of digital files and the coverage of a single object. Finally, aspects concerning the care and handling of the digital file are addressed within this dimension.</p>
	 
<p>The next dimension of context, <b>authentication</b>, is closely related to that of curatorial, as it concerns the verification of the digital content. This dimension includes how the content has been maintained and it addresses security issues. For example, this dimension asks who has had access to the digital data and who has been responsible for its protection. It also records information pertaining to any modifications made to the data after deposit and explains any changes that have been made to the data.</p>
	
<p><b>Authorization</b> is the dimension of context which records information concerning the intellectual property rights surrounding the digital content. This dimension identifies the copyright holder and delves into aspects surrounding rights management such as legal agreements regarding the specifics of access, use and exchange. </p>
	
<p>The final dimension, <b>intellectual</b>, is concerned with the significance of the original cultural object and, by proxy, its digital surrogate(s). This dimension contains information that is typically understood to be the scholarly record of an item. Information pertaining to an object's meaning, function, technique of manufacture, historical import, cultural narratives and the communication of ideas are addressed in this dimension.</p>

<p>Each dimension of context highlights a unique aspect important to future interactions with, and knowledge concerning, digital content. Some dimensions speak to an item's physical manifestation, several examine the digital expression and yet others deal with aspects that reflect the intellectual history surrounding an object. The variability seen in the dimensions' basic characteristics helps to highlight the complexities involved in recording contextual information about digital content, and point to the need for a framework within which to capture the critical information.</p>

<p>Cultural materials in a non-textual form are particularly challenging items to bring forward in time via digitization. In the case of these cultural objects lost knowledge about the original item and its digital surrogate is not easily recreated through a close reading of the object-surrogate itself. This situation means that a critical evaluation must be made of the kinds of data being recorded for cultural materials lest we run the risk of saving content that has no real useful future. </p>

<div class="divider-full">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Development of the Dimensions of Context</h3>

<p>As each dimension of context identified above is a somewhat abstract concept, a series of questions and prompts was developed to aid in the practical application of the framework. The questions and prompts presented here are not meant to be all-inclusive or applicable to every situation. However, in their current form they help to point out the breadth of  information that needs to be accounted for within each dimension. For example, the questions and prompts in the Technical dimension clearly address many areas; the format of the original and the digitized items, the digitization process, who performed the work, the size of the digital item, the hardware and software used in the creation of the item, what technologies will be needed for future access, naming of the archived file, file locations, and the names of associated files. Making each data collection point explicit in this way helps ensure that important contextual information is recorded for future use and understanding of the item.</p>
  
<p>Collecting useful contextual metadata for non-textual, cultural objects was the focus of this project. The framework was developed for this specific category of objects.  How well this framework would support text-based object metadata collection, or metadata for objects in domains outside of the cultural heritage sector, is not clear. </p>

<p>
<b>Meaning:</b> What was the artist expressing, or alternatively, what has the item come to signify?

</p>

<div class="divider-full">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Application of the Dimensions</h3>

<p>Even across non-textual cultural objects, practical application of the framework is likely to vary according to the needs and availability of institutional resources, as well as the specific items being preserved. For example, contextual information recorded in the framework for a scholarly research collection of items concerning Pre-Columbian pottery is likely to take a different form than that recorded for a limited number of items on the same topic held in a public library. The following examples, images of cultural objects chosen at random, show a practical application of the framework. Note that while the data recorded for many of the questions is factual, some of the entries were simulated to protect the privacy of individuals and institutions.</p>

<b>Scale of original:</b> wall height at highest point, approximately 2.5 meters<br />
<b>Material(s) of original:</b>  lime plaster and pigments<br />
<b>Technique(s) used in creation of original:</b> fresco secco<br />
<b>Surface/textural/auditory/olfactory characteristics:</b> Wall surfaces have applied lime plaster. Painted decoration was created through the use of natural pigments.<br />
<b>Behavior or functionality of original:</b> stationary, painted representation used for funerary purposes<br />
<b>Relationship(s) and, or arrangement of parts or items:</b> The walls and ceiling of the tomb have been painted. The painting represents a single scene of feasting within a tent in an outdoor setting, as can be seen by the plant life illustrated behind and beneath the couches and figures. A patchwork painted ceiling is found above the scene. Two confronting leopards with plants are painted in the pediment area above the main scene opposite the entrance.<br />
<b>Creator's intention:</b> Although the exact intent behind the creation of this painting is unknown, the painting in this tomb represents Etruscans feasting within a tent. Images of feasting found in funerary contexts are thought to be a reflection of the feast which took place at the time of interment of the deceased.

<b>Meaning:</b> This scene is interpreted as a composite of actual events and underworld activities. The painting represents a funeral complete with banquet, music and games. We know from other Etruscan tombs that Hades and Persephone, both underworld goddesses, partake in similar activities. One of the male figures shown in the image holds an egg, a common symbol in Mediterranean art which may have connections to the theme of renewal. The colorful ceiling of the tomb, with its checkerboard and concentric circle design, indicates that the event takes place under a tent. That the scene is set outdoors can be noted by the shrubs represented beneath and behind the couches. This event is believed to represent a funerary banquet which would have taken place just over a tomb's entrance at the time of the deceased person's interment.<br />
<b>Function:</b> Comforting the tomb's patron and the family and friends of the deceased.<br /> 
<b>Technology:</b> Carving of the tufa to form the tomb, choice of and processing of pigments, fresco painting technique.<br />
<b>Historical or cultural import:</b> This is fairly complex work for historical and cultural reasons. The lively figures represented are uniquely Etruscan, yet the artist of the central banquet scene also shows the influence of Greek art. The women's clothing is similar to those worn by their Greek counterparts, although there are distinctly Etruscan aspects to them. The men's mantles are purely Etruscan, however. An additional Etruscan aspect to the painting concerns the interaction taking place between the men and women. Here women and men are shown banqueting together, and this is in contrast to Greek scenes where women were excluded &#151; unless they were hetairai (courtesans). This may suggest that the role of women in Etruscan society was different than what was found among the Greeks at that same time. The rendering of women as light-skinned, while men are showed as dark-skinned is supported by a long artistic tradition. It speaks of women who do not spend time outside and all the cultural implications that go along with sheltering, protecting, and, or hiding women. Musical instruments represented are also noteworthy and they too have been borrowed from their Greek neighbors.<br />
<b>Cultural narratives:</b> A family gathering with eating, drinking, and music with a funerary purpose. This scene does not contain explicit imagery associated to the underworld. The scene provides us with a sense that the Etruscans had a refined and pleasant lifestyle. Interestingly, this joie de vivre is not present in all Etruscan funerary art. Other Etruscan tombs depict themes that are decidedly more violent and morbid. Although the variation in themes found in Etruscan tomb paintings is not well understood, it is believed that the themes may indicate political and familial dealings.

<b>Meaning:</b> although not overt, the work expresses the power and ingenuity of humankind. It is a powerful symbol of human accomplishment as the majority of the work was completed with basic hand tools and devices.<br />
<b>Function:</b> Bridge allows people and goods to pass over the East River between Brooklyn, New York and Manhattan, New York.<br /> 
<b>Technology:</b> Considered an important feat of engineering. John A. Roebling is credited with developing a massive twisted steel cable consisting of multiple strands of wire wrapped within an outer layer of wire. This cable became a standard material used in suspension bridges. The design of this bridge created the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time of its construction. Its colossal masonry towers and high, arching suspended deck, rising to 135 feet above the high mean water mark of the East River at its midpoint, were designed so that the many ships navigating the busy salt waters of the tidal straight would not be impeded. The 135 foot clearance of this bridge became the standard for future bridge construction. Roebling designed the bridge to withstand structural loads 5 times what it would be required to carry. These careful calculations have meant that the bridge has been able to withstand the heavier loads of modern vehicles and traffic and any potential weaknesses of materials. The bridge was widened from 4 to 6 lanes of traffic, with its deck trusses and approaches redesigned by David Steinman, between 1944 and 1954 after trolley cars no longer used the bridge to cross the East River.   <br />
<b>Historical or cultural import:</b> Beyond its technological importance to the history of bridge building and engineering in general, is the fact that the bridge allows easy access between Brooklyn and Manhattan. As Brooklyn's population was roughly 400,000 at the time the bridge was completed and the borough contained many rural areas, its construction helped ease the overcrowding in Manhattan and ushered in the development of Brooklyn.<br />
<b>Cultural narratives:</b> While the bridge has become an iconic symbol for the New York metropolitan area, it has had its share of misfortunes associated to it. Its architect, John A. Roebling, died as a result of an accident which occurred while he was examining a location for the Brooklyn tower of the bridge. Washington Roebling, who took over the position of chief engineer for the bridge after his father's demise, was paralyzed as a result of working in the caissons of the bridge. Emily (Warren) Roebling, Washington Roebling's wife, oversaw the completion of the bridge after his paralysis. Interestingly, she is not frequently acknowledged in the construction record for the bridge. In total, twenty individuals died as a result of the bridge's construction. Another twelve were killed within weeks of its opening in 1883 after a woman's scream panicked pedestrians who believed the bridge was going to collapse.

<h3>Future Work</h3>

<p>Testing of the framework in a practical setting with collections of digital cultural objects is needed in order to judge its usefulness to the preservation process. Testing the dimensions with various collections and in different settings would help determine their clarity and practicality in practice and so a prototype will be developed and tested by individuals in the cultural heritage sector. An additional analysis will be undertaken of the metadata associated with cultural objects in current practice and how what is found maps to the dimensions presented here.   </p>

<div class="divider-full">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The work presented here sought to discover a means of alleviating the contextual gap which exists in the metadata recorded for cultural objects digitized for preservation purposes. Contextual information is fundamental to understanding many aspects about digital content.  The framework presented here was developed to accommodate recording this critical information. Through the development of eight dimensions of context a fuller record of digital content is posited. As keepers of our cultural heritage, it is our responsibility to ensure that our  digital preservation efforts include recording contextual information about each object to enable future retrieval, assessment, management, access, and use. </p>
