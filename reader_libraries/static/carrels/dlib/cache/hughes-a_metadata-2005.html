In this article we describe the design and implementation of a full-featured metadata search engine within the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC).
Unlike many digital library search engines, this particular implementation has
a high degree of affinity with web search engines in terms of reasoning and results
display, and presumes no knowledge of the underlying metadata or database
structures on behalf of the user. Features of the search engine include a
variety of string matching algorithms; a thesaurus of alternate language names;
language code searching; keyword-in-context display in search results; search
for similarly spelled words; search for similar items; support for standard
string search operators and domain-specific inline syntax; and automatically
derived search links for other web search engines. A notable contribution of
this research is the inclusion in the search engine results of a metadata
quality-centric sorting algorithm.

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<p>
While much effort is invested in the creation of management and standards
infrastructure for digital libraries, it is in reality the end user interface that determines the degree to which
the rich metadata can be exploited for information retrieval tasks. Access to
the holdings of digital libraries through simple yet powerful search interfaces
is an often-neglected
area for the digital archives community. In short, we can observe a
juxtaposition of the rich metadata repositories with poor search facilities,
which leads to a lower return on investment (and corresponding incentives) for
the creation of rich metadata.
</p>

<p>
In this article, we report the design and implementation of a metadata search
engine within a specialised OAI [<a href="02hughes.html#1">1</a>] sub-domain, the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) [<a href="02hughes.html#2">2</a>].  The purpose of this engine is to provide a
powerful search facility across the collection of OLAC archives. Modeled on features common to web search engines, the service described here allows a
user to explore relevant archive holdings without requiring any knowledge of
the underlying data structures. Search results are displayed based on a
metadata quality ranking scheme that in turn is derived from the archive's adherence to best practice
recommendations in terms of metadata standards, both external and internal to
the community.
</p>

<p>The structure of this article is as follows: first we provide some background
regarding the community itself, followed by the motivation for the particular
work reported here. Next we describe the design and implementation of the
search engine. An evaluation of the search engine against other incumbent
services is then followed by the description of a number of items for future
work. Finally we reflect on the success of this service and consider the wider
implications for the digital libraries community as a whole. </p>

<H3>Background</H3>

<p>
The Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) is a consortium of linguistic
data archives, consisting of 31 archives and a corresponding catalogue of more than 28,000 objects described by metadata. For a more detailed description, we refer
interested readers to Bird and Simons, 2003 [<a href="02hughes.html#16">16</a>] and Simons and Bird, 2003 [<a href="02hughes.html#15">15</a>]. OLAC metadata is
based on Dublin Core, with a number of extensions [<a href="02hughes.html#14">14</a>] to the Dublin Core Metadata Set [<a href="02hughes.html#3">3</a>] for relevant conceptual domains such
as language [<a href="02hughes.html#9">9</a>], linguistic type [<a href="02hughes.html#6">6</a>], subject language [<a href="02hughes.html#7">7</a>] and linguistic subject [<a href="02hughes.html#8">8</a>] and linguistic role [<a href="02hughes.html#10">10</a>].
</p>

<p>Derived from the model adopted within the OAI, the OLAC model has a
two-tiered approach to implementation. <i>Data providers</i> are the institutional language archives that
publish their XML-based metadata according to the OAI Static Repository standard
[<a href="02hughes.html#4">4</a>]. Individual archives use a variety of
software to manage their catalogues internally. <i>Service providers</i> leverage the OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting [<a href="02hughes.html#5">5</a>] to harvest the XML expressions of
metadata catalogues. Within the OLAC community, typical practice is to
aggregate these into an SQL database using the OLAC Harvester
and Aggregator [<a href="02hughes.html#11">11</a>]. Service
providers can then build services that
utilise the union catalogue of OLAC metadata. </p>

<p>As a metadata community and a virtual digital library, OLAC has motivated a
number of developments at the OAI level, notably the need for supporting static
repositories [<a href="02hughes.html#4">4</a>], the development of
virtual service providers [<a href="02hughes.html#12">12</a>], and
personal metadata creation and management tools [<a href="02hughes.html#13">13</a>]. </p>

<p>Recent work by the authors [<a href="02hughes.html#17">17</a>] has resulted in a metadata quality
evaluation infrastructure being added to the suite of OLAC services. The work
here extends and leverages this earlier contribution and includes the quality
of metadata as a deterministic factor in the display of search results. </p>

<h3>Motivation </h3>

<p>The need to facilitate efficient information discovery in digital libraries
and archives is certainly not a new desiderata. However, it is notable that
with recent efforts to create standardised catalogues for digital archives and
libraries, much of the focus has been on the creation of rich metadata, rather
than discovery services that
effectively leverage metadata repositories to allow users to locate and
interact with data itself. </p>

<p>In this light, OLAC is no different. 
While resource discovery has been an underlying motivation for the
establishment of metadata standards and extensions for language resources,
tools that
allow non-domain-specialist users to search for, and locate resources of
interest have been largely neglected. Several specialist tools have emerged [<a href="02hughes.html#27">27</a>], [<a href="02hughes.html#28">28</a>]) but these do not provide
interfaces that are
intuitive to non-linguists, nor are they similar to widely
used web search engines with their inclusion of value-added
features. </p>

<p>Furthermore, metadata communities are often grounded in contexts where
collection management is the primary concern. As such, metadata creators
typically view rich metadata as inherently valuable in itself. However, we
believe that for a greater return on investment for metadata creation and
management, high quality end user services are required to expose the rich
metadata collections to wider audiences. </p>

<p>Our motivations in this context are therefore to address some of these needs
within the Open Language Archives Community. The goals of this work are
four-fold. </p>

<p>First, we seek to provide an information discovery service that
counters the perception that searching the web at large is more intuitive and
productive than searching within the catalogues of digital archives and
libraries. Second, we are concerned with reducing the barrier to entry&#151;
eliminating the need for understanding on behalf of the user of the underlying
metadata standards and database structures to effectively find information.
Third, we believe the qualitative dimension of
resource discovery allows opportunities to leverage the rich metadata collections
we have, and to use quality-centric metrics (such as those found in
Hughes [<a href="02hughes.html#17">17</a>]) as catalysts
for ranking and displaying search results. Fourth, and finally, we are
motivated by the need to provide compelling, value-added services as an
incentive to create metadata for language resources [<a href="02hughes.html#18">18</a>]. </p>

<h3>Search Engine Description</h3>

<p>In this section we describe the design of the search engine [<a href="02hughes.html#20">20</a>], adopting a
three-way distinction between the search input features, the search engine
logic, and the search results display. </p>

<h4>Search Input</h4>

<p>The user interface at the search entry point is deliberately simple: a
single text input field and the option to select one or all archives within
OLAC. There is no presupposition as to what the input keywords may be.
Minimally we
conceive that input may be one or more of: language name, country name,
linguistic data feature, personal name, 
or any combination of these types. Input is treated as case insensitive, and
supports standard search operators such as <code>AND</code>,
<code>OR</code>, etc. An additional feature is the support for inline syntax, derived from the
element names that
make up the OLAC metadata set (e.g.,
<code>creator: hale</code>), allowing a
significant degree of flexibility with regard to the granularity of a search. </p>

<h4>Search Engine Logic</h4>

<p>The search engine first uses exact word matching against a full text index
of metadata element content, soundex values for approximate string matching,
and Ethnologue [<a href="02hughes.html#23">23</a>] data providing
information on alternate language names. The default behaviour of the search is
to match exact words in the search string and to return records that
contain all words, using a full text index on the content of metadata elements.
If exact matching is not successful, a range of heuristics is applied to
determine the closest relevant matches. </p>

<p>When a search by default yields no results, our aim is to minimize the
number of mouse clicks a user requires to find information on either correct
spellings of the search term, or information on topics related to the original
search. In the event that there are no matching records found in the database,
the query string is first checked to determine whether it is a language name.
If it is the case that there are no records about an input language name, it is
assumed to be more helpful to present alternate names for the language, rather
than similarly spelled
words. (This approach is grounded in the context of the complexity of language
name standardisation, a well-known
problem in the domain). </p>

<p>Where this is not the case, similarly
spelled
words are suggested. These words are retrieved from a table of words and their
soundex values, the vocabulary consisting of all distinct words found in the
content of all OLAC metadata elements. The table is indexed on the soundex
value, to provide faster lookup. The words with soundex equal to that of the
search term are retrieved and sorted according to their Levenshtein edit
distance [<a href="02hughes.html#24">24</a>] from the search
term. Similarly, language names from the Ethnologue tables that
have identical soundex values are ranked by Levenshtein distance and displayed
as possible corrections to the original query string. Again, this separation of
similarly spelled
words and similarly spelled
language names makes an assumption that language names are most frequently
searched. </p>

<p>The search engine also features an integrated domain thesaurus and ontology,
derived from the authoritative source of language name classification, the SIL
Ethnologue [<a href="02hughes.html#23">23</a>]. If the search string
is identified as derivative of a language or country name, this is detected (by
use of the Ethnologue data on alternate language and dialect names) and the
user is presented with links to launch queries related to that language or
country. Where the original search is for a language name, a link is available
to view records that use
an alternate name for that language or records that
provide information on a dialect of the originally searched language.
Similarly, if the original search string is a country name, a list of languages
that are
spoken in that country can be viewed. Recognising language and country names
allows a link to the Ethnologue entry on that search term to be presented where
relevant. Furthermore, the use of the domain thesaurus and ontology also allows
users with linguistic domain
knowledge to search by <i>language code</i>,
which is a commonly used approach in other language resource repositories.</p>

<h4>Search Results Display</h4>

<p>Search results are grouped by archive, with the archives sorted based upon
the aggregate of metadata quality scores for the retrieved records (and based
on the work reported in Hughes [<a href="02hughes.html#17">17</a>]). This provides a balance in the
presentation of search results between the quantity of matching records found
in an archive and the quality of those records. </p>

<p>Each retrieved record displays the element containing the matching word with
key-word-in-context (KWIC) highlighting. Elements that
have been deemed useful in providing information of record content (<code>title</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>subject</code>,
<code>date</code>, <code>identifier</code>) are used to provide
additional summary information. </p>

<p>A number of additional utilities are provided to the user in the context of
search results. These include links to instantiate precomposed queries for
alternate names; language-code based searching; links to the Ethnologue; and
precomposed combinatorial
web queries for language names and linguistic domain-specific terms. </p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>The metadata quality assessment service is built on top of the foundational
layer provided by the OLAC Harvester and Aggregator [<a href="02hughes.html#11">11</a>], and the metadata quality evaluation
service, the OLAC Archive Reports [<a href="02hughes.html#17">17</a>].
</p>

<p>The implementation uses open source technologies MySQL [<a href="02hughes.html#21">21</a>] and PHP [<a href="02hughes.html#22">22</a>],
and it can be
installed on a range of platforms. The operational instance of the OLAC Search Engine can be viewed online [<a href="02hughes.html#20">20</a>]. The software has been released
under an open source license and is freely available to
interested parties from Sourceforge [<a href="02hughes.html#19">19</a>]. </p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p>There are a number of other search services to which our contribution can be
legitimately compared, as there are several search engines
operational in the OLAC context. Here we compare our work to three specific services,
and reflect on the relative strengths and weaknesses of each of the incumbent
services. </p>

<p>Search OLAC Archives [<a href="02hughes.html#25">25</a>] is an
example of a very basic search engine and provides single keyword
search over harvested archives from the union catalogue. Our implementation is
similar in that it operates as a service over the union catalogue of OLAC
metadata. However, our implementation is significantly more powerful and more
fully featured in many areas, including support for up to 5 keywords. </p>

<p>The OLAC Web Crawler Gateway is
a customised version of the OAI DP9 gateway service ([<a href="02hughes.html#26">26</a>]) that
allows indexing of an OAI data provider by an Internet search engine. DP9 does
this by providing a persistent URL for repository records and
converting this to an OAI query against the appropriate repository when the URL
is requested. This allows search engines that do not support the OAI protocol
to index the "deep web" contained within OAI-compliant repositories. Thus the
user is constrained only by their choice of web search engine, since these
engines are in fact the entry point to the OLAC data. While the motivation
behind the DP9 interface is different to our own, we do note that there is a
feature in common between our two implementations: the ability to search for a
metadata record using an OAI record identifier. For searching motivated by
third-party referencing, this feature is invaluable. Furthermore, our engine
does not preclude a
broad coverage search engine being used to complement finer-grained searching. </p>

<p>The LinguistList offers two implementations of an OLAC search engine ([<a href="02hughes.html#27">27</a>] and [<a href="02hughes.html#28">28</a>]). In the default Search mode,
searching is supported by up to 10 keywords, but only within the <code>title</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>creator</code>
and <code>contributor</code> elements. The
search engine reported here, while not being able to support such a large
number of keywords, allows a full text search of the union catalogue, and hence
has a greater depth. However, it is possible to search by a
constrained set of elements using the inline syntax method described earlier.
In the LinguistList Advanced Search mode, searching is supported by up to 10
keywords, with the ability for the user to specify closer constraints such as
the archive of interest, specific elements (e.g.,
<code>title</code>, <code>creator</code>, <code>contributor</code>) or to choose
codes from particular controlled vocabularies <code>subject</code>, <code>language</code>,
<code>type</code>, <code>discourse type</code>. The latter feature is
also found in our search engine, although we support the function by virtue of
inline syntax and in fact extend it to
include any metadata element (either Dublin Core or OLAC). Furthermore, our
approach allows a
user to select finer-grained search context directly from the result display,
rather than in advance for any
information retrieval task. </p>

<p>We can see from this comparison that the contribution described here
provides all of the functionality found in other instantiations within OLAC,
extends a number of existing functions, and provides a range of new features.
Thus we believe our contribution is valuable in allowing the user great
flexibility in approach to searching for language resources, by combining
existing and discovered knowledge about language resources to increase the
precision of search results. </p>

<h3>Future</h3>

<p>Now that we have described
our full-featured
search engine within the OLAC domain, we turn to a discussion of future work.
We identify three natural extensions to the work reported here: support for similar
metadata record searching, the development of an API, and user-centric
functionality modifications. </p>

<p>Web search engines such as Google provide a function enabling a search for similar results
to a user-selected item. We would like to extend the work here to also allow
such functionality, and we can conceive of three dimensions of similarity:
metadata records of a similar score; metadata records with similar core
elements (<code>title</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>subject</code>, <code>date</code> and <code>identifier</code>);
and metadata records from similar archives. </p>

<p>Within the OLAC context a precedent has
already been set for machine-executable services for discovery of
language resources [<a href="02hughes.html#12">12</a>]. Within the web
search engine community such features are also common e.g.
Google API [<a href="02hughes.html#29">29</a>]). We would like to
extend the search engine described here to also facilitate machine-instantiated
information retrieval in a similar fashion. </p>

<p>Crucial to the success of any search engine is customisation to the specific
needs of the user community. Web search engine usability metrics and case
studies (see, for example, Nielsen
[<a href="02hughes.html#30">30</a>]) motivate the active analysis of
user interaction with a search service, and subsequent modifications to reflect
the way in which users actually interact with the search engine. We propose
therefore to undertake an extended evaluation of the types of searches that
users conduct, and the types of result manipulation they undertake,
in order to customise the user interface and underlying functionality to better
serve those users interested in language
resources. </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Our work here has resulted in the deployment of a full-featured
search engine, perhaps more typical of a web search engine than those
traditionally found within libraries. We believe that some of the features
typically found in web search engines can be offered within the digital
libraries and archives community, with a corresponding improvement not only in
information retrieval terms of precision and recall, but also in terms of user
experience. We offer our approach and implementation to the broader digital
libraries community in the hope that the model and implementation may benefit a
larger range of institutional data providers and,
ultimately, end-users. </p>
