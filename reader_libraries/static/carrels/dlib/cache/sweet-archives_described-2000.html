<h3>What makes archives different?</h3>

<p>At the Public Record Office, the UK National Archives, three keywords sum up
our role: selection; preservation; access.  Access applies not only directly
to the records in whatever form but also via an intermediary, the finding
aid or catalogue.</p>

<p>Archives have their own very particular features which are explicitly
recognised in their description.  First and foremost, they are hierarchical:
one person's/family's/corporate body's archives are broken down into
components which can themselves be further broken down, layer after
potential layer into the smallest describable component.  Archival
description is multi-level.  It is also based firmly on the concept of
provenance.  What is being described has been created and accumulated by an
identifiable body (or bodies).</p>

<p>The General International Standard for Archival Description, ISAD(G),
published in 1994, with a second edition due out in September 2000, is
widely recognised and increasingly adhered to.  Its popularity stems from
its being firmly rooted in tradition and in its being a fairly permissive
compilation of best practice. ISAD(G) incorporates a wide range of data
elements for archival description, a small number of which it prescribes as
mandatory for international data exchange. It embodies the principle of
multi-level description and takes as its underlying premise four rules of
multi-level description: go from the general to the specific; provide
information relevant to the level of description; link descriptions; avoid
redundancy of information. These rules have, to date, served archivists
well.</p>

<H3>Traditional use of collection level description</h3>

<p>Unlike books, which are stand-alone products, archival documents can only be
understood in the context in which they were created. T.S.Eliot's <em>The Four
Quartets</em> by itself is readily accessible to users. A file of miscellaneous
correspondence, on the other hand, can only be understood if it is known who
wrote it and when it was written. Even then, the information needs to be
qualified: a Treasury file of correspondence would have a different
significance if it were produced by that part of the Treasury which dealt
with public expenditure rather than by the part which dealt with the management of the
economy.  For this reason, archives have traditionally been described in
terms of the organisation (usually a public body or private company) that 
created and accumulated them.</p>

<p>The fashion for describing archives has gradually changed over time.  The
Public Record Office (PRO), London, was founded in 1838 and moved into its
first building in Chancery Lane in the early 1850s.  At the same time, FS
Thomas produced the first guide to the PRO.  He used what would now be seen
as a curious hybrid system.  The records were described by their creating
department - largely the medieval courts - but within those courts they were
described by subject.  So, the records of the Exchequer were described at
collection level as Exchequer records and a short administrative history was
given.  The records were then described by subject - 'Abbeys, Accounts,
Acquitances', etc.</p>

<p>This pattern of describing records by collection and then by subject was the
norm at the PRO for the next 70 years. It was not until 1923 that M.V.
Giuseppi produced what was the first modern guide to the Public Record
Office.  This gave the administrative history of each department and then
went on to describe the divisions into which it was organised and then
individual series of documents, ranging from medieval rolls to modern files.
For the Exchequer, there was a detailed administrative history that focused
on the records it generated, followed by an administrative history of each
of the Exchequer's divisions.  Finally, all the Exchequer's file series were
described.</p>

<p>Giuseppi's model continued up to the 1960s when the last printed guide to
the PRO was published.   The great value of printed, high level guides to
holdings was, before the advent of the World Wide Web, their provision of
remote access (however limited) to the holdings of record offices. By the
1960s, however, the volume of modern records flowing into the PRO was so
large that conventional print media could not keep up.   The new style
Current Guide of the 1970s onwards was produced annually but only for a
strictly limited circulation at the PRO and a couple of other London
institutions.  A microfiche version was published at irregular intervals.
For its first 150 years, the PRO, like most archives, had a dual approach to
describing its holdings.  Like most  other archives it had separate,
paper-based systems for providing access to collection-level descriptions
and to individual items.</p>

<h3>Why go beyond collection level description?</h3>


<p>Although collection level descriptions are of enormous value to some
researchers, particularly those who are conducting research into the history
of individuals or of institutions, they are of limited value on their own to
the broad range of researchers.  This is because what researchers wish to
see are individual files and it is only possible to identify detailed files
from multi-level catalogues.</p>

<p> Some
academic and other researchers would be interested to learn from the PRO's
collection level catalogue entry that the PRO has the records of service of
officers in World War One; the PRO's series level scope and content note 
indicates that. This series (WO 339) contains records and correspondence for Regular Army
and Emergency Reserve officers who served in the First World War.  The
content of the files varies enormously, from a note supplying date of death,
to a file of several parts containing attestation papers, record of service,
personal correspondence and various other information.
Records of British reserve officers who were commissioned into the Indian
Army were originally held separately, but later added to this series.
For the majority of the series there is no correspondence date range, and the
nominal description has been abbreviated to surname and initial.</p>

<p>However, our experience is that most of our family historian users are interested in the
records of  individual officers, whether it is because they are tracing
their ancestors or pursuing an interest in World War One poets. Consequently, they are far better served by having access both to the series entry and
to an online list of all those officers whose records survive.</p>

<p>Similar problems are posed by very large series. For example, the main series
of Home Office papers at the PRO has 26,000 files.  The series level scope
and content note is relatively comprehensive:</p>

<Blockquote>This is the main series of Home Office papers. The subject matter of the
files reflects the diversity of domestic matters dealt with by the Home
Office. These have included aliens, betting and gaming, borstals, building
societies, burials and cremations, bye-laws, changes of name, the Channel
Islands, charities, children, civil juries, drugs, ecclesiastical matters,
elections, explosives, extradition, factories, fire services, firearms,
honours, Ireland and subsequently Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man,
magistrates, markets and fairs, Lords Lieutenant, mental patients and
criminal lunatics, naturalization, pardons, petitions of right, poisons,
police, prisons, prostitution, public order, use of royal title by
institutions and companies, universities, vivisection, wartime measures,
warrants and wild birds.</blockquote>

<p>Further Home Office papers are in a supplementary series, HO 144:</p>

<Blockquote>These are files on criminal and certain other subjects, separated from the main file
series in HO 45 because of their sensitivity at the time of transfer.</blockquote>

<p>Both series are described clearly and accurately in conformance to standards
and would be of great value to any researcher who is interested in broad
issues of policy.  They are of less use to people interested in particular
individuals: there is nothing to tell the researcher that HO 45 contains the
papers relating to the conviction of Timothy Evans for a murder he did not
commit nor that HO 144 contains the Home Office's files on Dr. Crippen and 
the Jack the Ripper murders in Whitechapel.</p>

<p>In practice many archive users require clear, accurate and searchable
descriptions of individual files (or their equivalents).  They then move
'bottom upwards' to see the context in which the documents were created and
used.  A researcher into the Welsh Aberfan tip disaster may start with a
keyword search for all references to the disaster but will very quickly see
the value, if not the necessity, of knowing exactly which of all the bodies
connected to the disaster and subsequent inquiry produced the records in
question.</p>

<p>Technology in the late twentieth century made it possible to unite
description of the whole with description of the component layers making up
that whole.  The emergence of the World Wide Web made remote access to full,
up to date catalogues a possibility, and a ready-made means of providing
multi-level description in an automated environment was established with the
advent of Encoded Archival Description (EAD) in the mid 1990s.  EAD, a
document type definition of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), was
specifically designed for multi-level archival description.  Largely because
it maps so well to ISAD(G) there has been a large, international, take up of
EAD.  Many institutions have mapped existing finding aids to EAD; many
have developed EAD templates for new cataloguing.  Even where database
solutions have been adopted for archival catalogues, a requirement has often
been that the system should be capable of EAD import and export.  In a very
short space of time EAD has taken on the role of chief means of data
exchange for archival descriptions.  It has proven popular because it can provide one stop access to the description of the whole
archive together with its parts.
</p>

<h3>Why stay with collection level description?</h3>    

<p>Real life for all too many archival institutions consists of running to try
to stay still.  Too few resources, in terms of money and skilled staff,
combine with increased pressure for service.  Very often the immediate has
to take precedence over the important or, at the very least, the demands of
the immediate preclude a fully worked through strategy of balancing
priorities.  Cataloguing backlogs build up.  In almost every case, a decent
collection level description of each of an institution's holdings is
prepared as a necessary control in the accessioning process.  Very often,
though, more detailed cataloguing has to take its turn in the queue.
Priority there may be determined strictly chronologically or may be decided
by such factors as importance, user demand or particular staff skills
available.</p>

<p>Even when the whole archive has been fully catalogued, there may be great
dissatisfaction with the results.  With legacy finding aids, the standard of
archival description may be judged too poor or too idiosyncratic for a
modern global audience.  Too much may have been dependent on the human eye's
interpretation of layout on a printed page or understanding of particular
typing conventions.  Data elements may have been mixed in together to form
one mass of 'description' or levels, jumbled in a way that a machine will all
too quickly expose but which a person browsing through page after page may
not pick up.</p>

<p>When thinking in terms of retroconversion from paper based finding aids to
electronic form, and especially for presentation on the Web, difficult
choices about priorities sometimes have to be made.  One such choice can be
between depth and breadth:  whether in the short term it is more beneficial
to end users to have multi-level catalogues of some archives available
remotely or whether it is more useful to view across the board collection
level descriptions that indicate the locations of the archives  (together
with more detailed listings when these exist).</p>

<p>For one or more of the reasons noted above, a significant number of
individual record offices, or of bodies working together to form a network,
have decided to focus, at least in the short term, on providing collection
level descriptions of their holdings on the Web.</p>

<p>A further consideration may be the applicability of ISAD(G) to cataloguing
in an automated environment.  ISAD(G) emerged from the world of paper based
finding aids.  Avoiding redundancy of information, avoiding repetition of
information from one level to another made total sense.  But what of the
world of automation?  What of the possibility of an isolated 'hit' in
response to a particular search?  How does the end user make sense of the
'hit' without adequate contextual information being returned as part of or
with the hit?  Do we need brand new rules of archival description for an
automated environment, with a global, and largely unknown, audience?  Is it
safer for now to stick with collection level description for any other
context than the local one, where human intervention is to hand?</p>

<h3>Why Multi-level description?</h3>

<p>We may well have to rethink or readjust some of the standards we follow as
we take on fully the promises and challenges of online delivery of our
archival catalogues.  What we do know is that existing users want full
catalogues on the Web and that new users (previously hampered by geography,
limited mobility, lack of resources or simply unaware of the possibilities
offered by archival research) will benefit most by remote access to the
whole together with its parts.</p>
