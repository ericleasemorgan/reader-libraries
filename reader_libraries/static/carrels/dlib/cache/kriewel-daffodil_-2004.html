<H3 class="blue">Abstract</H3>
<p class="blue">
<small> DAFFODIL</small> is a search system for digital libraries aiming at
  <I>strategic support</I> during the information search process.
  From a user point of view this strategic support is mainly
  implemented by high-level search functions, so-called stratagems,
  which provide functionality beyond today's digital libraries.
  Through the tight integration of stratagems and with the federation
  of heterogeneous digital libraries, D<SMALL>AFFODIL</SMALL> reaches high
  effects of synergy for information and services. These effects
  provide high-quality metadata for the searcher through an
  intuitively controllable user interface. The implementation of
  stratagems follows a tool-based model. 
</p>


<H3>
1 Introduction
</H3>

<P>
In many scientific communities a large number of digital libraries is
available for online research. These federated libraries are by nature
highly heterogeneous with regard to functionality, query language,
and user interface, thereby requiring systems that provide a unified
way of accessing them. However, while a unified access to the
federated libraries is clearly needed, for many real applications a
richer, a more powerful set of high-level search functions is necessary
to support searching in an effective way [<A
 HREF="06kriewel.html#Fuhr_etal:00">Fuhr et al. 2000</A>].</p>

<P>
<small>DAFFODIL</small> (<B>D</B>istributed <B>A</B>gents
  <B>f</B>or User-<B>F</B>riendly Access <B>o</B>f
  <B>Di</B>gital <B>L</B>ibraries) is a system for integrated
search within the heterogeneous digital libraries of a scientific
community, with merging of results. At this time, a prototype for the
area of Computer Science exists that allows searching within more than
ten different digital libraries and other sources of information. The
available high-level search functions, implemented in a number of
integrated tools, provide users with strategic support
[<A
 HREF="06kriewel.html#Fuhr_etal:02">Fuhr et al. 2002</A>].</p>



<H3>
2 Searching with <small>DAFFODIL</small>
</H3>

<P>
<small>DAFFODIL</small> combines browsing and searching strategies in a natural
way. The system supports collaborative search and provides the user
with awareness, i.e., it provides information of new or changed objects
related to previous searches. Users are free in choosing a search
strategy, but the system assists them by providing easy access to
well-known search tactics or stratagems, and in helping them to
combine these for creating a comprehensive search plan.</p>

<P>
Based on empirical observations of the information seeking behaviour
of experienced library users, Bates [<A
 HREF="06kriewel.html#Bates:79a">Bates 1979a</A>,<A
 HREF="06kriewel.html#Bates:79">Bates 1979b</A>]
identified a number of successful tactics for the information search.
In [<A
 HREF="06kriewel.html#Bates:90">Bates 1990</A>] tactics referring to monitoring, file structure,
search formulation, term selection, and ideas are described.</p>

<P>
The list of tools in this and the following section is not exhaustive
but concentrates on the most important services providing higher
search functionalities. The desktop of <small>DAFFODIL</small> is designed for
extensibility and new tools can easily be integrated into the system.</p>



<H4>
2.1 The search tool
</H4>

<P>
The search tool may be the most commonly used of the possible starting
points for searching within D<SMALL>AFFODIL</SMALL>. It provides a form-based interface
for formulating queries to the federated digital libraries in a
uniform way, and allows specification of the search domain by
selecting some or all of the available libraries.</p>

<P>
Wrappers map the uniform queries onto the query languages of the
information providers. Results are merged and presented to the user
(along with a paraphrase of the submitted query) in
a homogeneous way for viewing and navigation. Unintrusive icons are
used to mark documents that have previously been seen, stored or that
have been interacted with in other ways (as seen in fig.
<A HREF="06kriewel.html#fig1">1</A>). On the list of results, term extraction can be
used to get commonly occurring terms, authors, journal or conference
titles.</p>

<H4>
2.2 Personal library
</H4>

<P>
Queries, results, fulltexts, terms, authors, conferences or journals can be
stored in the personal library, where they are saved for accessing
them beyond the context of the current search. With personal folders
users can structure their results, and can build a personal archive of
interesting documents and other objects. For using search results
outside of the <small>DAFFODIL</small> system, export functions are
available. Group folders with the possibility for annotations on
objects, including previous annotations, provide support for
collaborative search. Based on the personal folders of a user, the
system provides awareness and recommendations.</p>

<H4>
2.3 Active Tools
</H4>

<P>
A number of tools provide active support during the search, e.g., for the
formulation of queries. They provide tactical help for improving a
query with the goal of getting more hits or more exact hits.</p>

<P>
The <I>'Did you mean?'</I> tool analyses the search terms used in a
query, and suggests alternative (or corrected) spellings. Other tools
find synonyms or related terms for a given query, where <I>related
  terms</I> means those terms that often appear in the same context
within documents as the search terms.</p>

<P>
Finally, a tool for names of authors suggests possible completions for
incompletely specified names, e.g., names that are missing a first
name.</p>



<H3>
3 Strategic Support
</H3>

<P>
While commonly available search systems often supply only simple and
very basic search operations, D<SMALL>AFFODIL</SMALL> tries to enable
non-experts in searching effectively by tight integration of
high-level search functions. Whereas typical information systems only
support low-level search functions, so-called moves, Bates
[<A
 HREF="06kriewel.html#Bates:90">Bates 1990</A>] introduced three higher levels of abstraction for the
categorization of search functionalities:</p>



<UL>
<LI><I>Tactics</I> are understood to be one or a small number of basic
  search moves combined into a single search operation: e.g., the steps
  necessary to broaden or narrow a query, or the generalization of a
  search term.
</LI>
<LI><I>Stratagems</I> are a complex set of actions composed of basic
  moves and tactics that exploit the information structure of a single
  search domain.
</LI>
<LI><I>Strategy</I> we call a complete plan for executing an entire
  search. Strategies are usually composed of a number of basic moves,
  tactics, and stratagems.
</LI>
</UL>  

<P>
D<SMALL>AFFODIL</SMALL> focuses on the stratagem level and provides users with
strategic support during the information search process. The aim is to
enable users to use complex search strategies with relative ease. For
visualising the strategic support, an object-oriented tool-based model
is used. On the desktop of D<SMALL>AFFODIL</SMALL>, the set of available
stratagems is represented as a set of tools, that can be invoked in
several ways, e.g., by dragging a digital library object onto it. </p>



<H4>
3.1 References and Citations
</H4>


<P>
With the reference tool (fig. <A HREF="06kriewel.html#fig3">3</A>) it is possible to
find referencing or referenced documents for an existing document. The
tool can be activated intuitively by dragging and dropping a document
from other tools. The results can be reused to find more references,
used within another tool for further searches, or they can be stored
in the personal library.</p>



<P>&nbsp;</P>

</TABLE>
</DIV>
<P align="center">For a larger view of the image, click <a href="ref_conf.jpg" target="_blank">here</a></P>


      
<H4>
3.2 Journals and Conferences
</H4>

<P>
For browsing and searching in journal volumes and conference
proceedings, the journal and conference tools (fig. <A HREF="06kriewel.html#fig3">3</A>)
are available. Users can search for titles of scientific journals or
conferences to browse within the results&#151;often with direct access
to metadata on articles or even links to fulltexts.</p>

<P>
These browsers can be used as a starting point or an intermediary step
in a larger search plan. Explicit links in the detail views of search
results point to the journal or conference proceeding where a document
was published. Activating them will open the respective tool at the
corresponding journal or proceedings.</p>



<H4>
3.3 Author Networks
</H4>

<P>
Another stratagem directly supported by D<SMALL>AFFODIL</SMALL> is the author
search. Starting from an author whose relevance to the search interest
is known, it is possible to search for further publications by this
author, or to exploit the co-author relationships of the author for
deriving a collaboration network [<A
 HREF="06kriewel.html#Fuhr_etal:02">Fuhr et al. 2002</A>].</p>



<P>&nbsp;</P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="fig4"></A><A NAME="75"></A>
<TABLE>
<CAPTION ALIGN="BOTTOM"><STRONG>Figure 4: 
Author networks: browser and visualisation.</STRONG></CAPTION>
<TR><TD><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG 
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="daffodil2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="266" 
 ALT="Author Network"></DIV></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>
<P align="center">For a larger view of the image, click <a href="daffodil2.jpg" target="_blank">here</a></P>

<P>
In such a network which can also be visualised in a relationship graph
(fig. <A HREF="06kriewel.html#fig4">4</A>) it is easy to identify central authors and
to find authors who often publish together. Since the authors are
ranked by centrality, the user may also find that other authors than
the original one are more central to the search topic, and can use
these for further searches. </p>



<H4>
3.4 Classifications
</H4>

<P>
The <I>classification tool</I> provides users with access to a
hierarchical, topic oriented representation of the search domain. It
allows the browsing of classification schemes like the ACM Computing
Classification System.</p>



<H4>
3.5 Thesauri
</H4>

<P>
The <I>thesaurus tool</I> can be used to get more general or more
specific terms (hypernyms or hyponyms), or semantic definitions for a
search term. Subject specific and web-based thesauri are used for
finding related terms. The resulting terms can then easily be used in
other tools for further queries.</p>



<H3>
4 Conclusion
</H3>

<P>
A three phase, qualitative evaluation [<a href="06kriewel.html#Klas_etal:04">Klas et al. 2004</a>] with 28 participants of
differing search experience supported the underlying model and
fulfilled the expectations in the system. Due to the tight integration
of high-level search functionalities through the graphical tools, D<SMALL>AFFODIL</SMALL> makes efficient and effective searching possible. The
concept of strategic support is realized at all levels of the system;
the personal library supports personalization and group work. A user
is enabled by D<SMALL>AFFODIL</SMALL> to apply complex search strategies in a
natural manner. The presentation of search results by D<SMALL>AFFODIL</SMALL>
eases the cognitive load of interpreting the information.</p>

<P>
The development of D<SMALL>AFFODIL</SMALL> continues. Currently, major areas of work include strategic support, pro-active help and
awareness. D<SMALL>AFFODIL</SMALL> is used successfully at the Institute of
Informatics and Interactive Systems at the University of
Duisburg-Essen in  Germany.</p>
