<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The description of collections is becoming increasingly
important in the context of networked information services and is an
important underpinning for developing a collective resource. This
view has emerged clearly through the MODELS project [<a href="09powell.html#ref1">1</a>], where it
has influenced the course of the clumps and hybrid libraries [<a href="09powell.html#ref2">2</a>]
who are working with collection and service descriptions, and in
UKOLN's recent work on retrospective conversion [<a href="09powell.html#ref3">3</a>]. In the latter
case, a strong view is emerging that libraries need to complement
item-based description with description at a higher level. A
particular feature of this discussion is that this would complement
current work in the archives community and that descriptions at
this shared level of granularity would facilitate cross-domain
working (while acknowledging that <i>collections</i> may mean
different things in the different library, archival and other content
models). This has been corroborated by recent work which looks at research issues shared by libraries, archives and museums, where it was recognized that description
at this level would support higher level navigation of the cultural
resource and selection of particular resources for further searching [<a href="09powell.html#ref4">4</a>].
</p>

<p>The creation of collection descriptions allows the owners or
curators of collections to disclose information about their
existence and availability to interested parties. Although
collection descriptions may take the form of unstructured textual
documents, for example a set of Web pages describing a collection,
there are significant advantages in describing collections using
structured, open, standardized, machine-readable formats. Such
descriptions enable:</p>

<ul>
<li>users to discover and locate collections of interest,</li></ul>

<ul><li>users to perform searches across multiple collections in a
controlled way,</li></ul>

<ul><li>the refinement of distributed searching approaches based on the characteristics of candidate
collections,
</li></ul>

<ul><li>software to perform such tasks on behalf of users, based on
known user preferences.</li></ul>
   

<p>There are additional advantages where catalogues do not exist
for collections, as a collection description may provide some
indication to the remote user of content and coverage.</p>

<p>This article describes work undertaken as part of the RSLP
Collection Description Project, a project funded by the UK Research
Support Libraries Programme (RSLP) [<a href="09powell.html#ref5">5</a>] with the aim of enabling all
projects funded through the programme to describe collections in a
consistent and machine readable way. With additional funding from
OCLC, the project has developed a model of collections and their
catalogues [<a href="09powell.html#ref6">6</a>]. We have used this work to form the basis of a
collection description metadata schema [<a href="09powell.html#ref7">7</a>], implemented using the
Resource Description Framework (RDF) [<a href="09powell.html#ref8">8</a>]. A Web-based tool has been
developed that allows the construction of RDF descriptions by
filling in a Web form [<a href="09powell.html#ref9">9</a>]. Associated with this tool there is a
detailed set of data entry guidelines [<a href="09powell.html#ref10">10</a>] and an enumerated list of
collection types [<a href="09powell.html#ref11">11</a>]. Future work will see the development of a
Web robot that will harvest collection descriptions from project
Web sites and make them available through a central search
service.</p>

<p>
Although it has its origin in the Research Support Libraries Programme,
many of whose results will be digital resources of one kind or another,
our work is not restricted to the description of digital collections.
It is intended that the results of the
project should be applicable to physical and
digital collections of all kinds, including library, art and museum
materials.  It is by no means applicable only to the resources of
large research libraries.
</p>

<p>In the specific context of the
Programme, the intention of the project was to offset the costs of
not adopting a consistent, machine-readable description at an early
stage. Such a cost may have fallen on users and managers of
collections alike:</p>

<ul>
<li>For users, there would have been the burden of having to
individually find and navigate particular Web sites, interpret
differently formatted descriptions, and limited opportunity of
consistent, search based approaches.</li></ul>

<ul><li>For managers, there would have been the burden of having to
design their own local approaches, and at some future date of
having to redo this work to conform to a consistent approach.</li>
</ul>


<p>Our work suggests that requirements for collection description
fall into three broad informational categories. Firstly,
descriptive information about the collection. This may include the
subject area, ownership, strengths and weaknesses and sources of
items within the collection. Secondly, information about how to
access the collection, including physical access, in the case of
library, museum or archival collections for example, or networked
access in the case of digital collections. Thirdly, the terms and
conditions associated with access to the collection and individual
items within it.</p>

<p>The term <i>collection</i> can be applied to any aggregation of
individual items. 
Collections are exemplified in the following,
non-exhaustive, list: library collections; museum collections;
archives; library, museum and archival catalogues; digital
archives; Internet directories; Internet subject gateways; robot
generated Web indexes; collections of text, images, sounds,
datasets, software, other material or combinations of these (this
includes databases, CD-ROMs and collections of Web resources);
other collections of physical items.</p>

<p>This is a broad list, of overlapping categories. However, it
suggests the need for a planned approach, both so that techniques
adopted fit in well with broader resource discovery directions and
so that techniques are flexible enough to cope with the many
collection types that libraries will develop and indicate the
relationships between them. It is worth noting that the list
includes collections of
physical items, collections of digital surrogates of physical
items and collections of <i>born-digital</i> items.
It is also worth noting that some
collections are actually catalogues (metadata) for other
collections.
For example, a library catalogue typically describes
the items in one or more collections within a library. Finally, it
is worth noting that collections are often composed of other
collections.</p>

<h3>An analytic model of collections and their catalogues</h3>

<p>The collection description model
is aimed in the first instance at those responsible
for the development of collection descriptions. It is also a
general contribution to the debate about metadata in the digital
age. As described above, its initial use is to inform the
construction of a demonstrator to which all relevant RSLP projects
can feed information. Although the primary purpose of this model is
to illumine the process of resource discovery by users, collection
description also serves collection management purposes,
particularly in discharging an institution's curatorial
responsibilities. The work focuses primarily on the needs of
libraries in describing their collections but also takes into
account the requirements of other sectors.
Collection description itself may take a
variety of forms, and the model makes no presumption about the
format of such a description.</p>

<p>The information landscape can be seen as a contour map in which
there are mountains, hillocks, valleys, plains and plateaus. A
large general collection of information, for example a research
library, can be seen as a plateau, raised above the surrounding
plain. A specialized collection of particular importance is like a
sharp peak. Upon a plateau there might be undulations representing
strengths and weaknesses. The scholar surveying this landscape is
looking for the high points. A high point represents an area where
the potential for gleaning desired information by visiting that
spot (physically or by remote means) is greater than that of other
areas. To continue the analogy, the scholar is concerned at the
initial survey to identify areas rather than specific features - to
identify rainforest rather than to retrieve an analysis of the
canopy fauna of the Amazon basin. The model attempts to
characterize that initial part of the process of information
retrieval. The landscape is, however, multidimensional. Where one
scholar may see a peak another may see a trough. The task is to
devise mapping conventions that enable scholars to read the map of
the landscape fruitfully, at the appropriate level of generality or
specificity.</p>

<p>The IFLA study <i>Functional Requirements of Bibliographic
Records</i> [<a href="09powell.html#ref12">12</a>] identifies (pp. 8-9) four functions of records,
progression through which may be seen as constituting a successful
traverse of the information landscape and the attainment of one's
goal. These are:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>To find</b></dt>

<dd>to provide access points by which information can be
found.</dd>

<dt><b>To identify</b></dt>

<dd>to describe something so as to enable users correctly to
interpret records retrieved.</dd>

<dt><b>To select</b></dt>

<dd>to provide a means for users to choose from among the
identified records.</dd>

<dt><b>To obtain</b></dt>

<dd>to acquire the identified materials.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The first two of these activities are associated with the
traditional areas of catalogue codes, access and description. The
relations they embody are characteristically static or at least
persistent. A static model may adequately represent them - they are
the map of the landscape. The second two reflect the more active
operations involved in retrieving and using information; they are
transactional in nature, and a dynamic or event-driven model may be
more appropriate for them - they represent attempts to use the map
to reach the areas of interest.</p>

<p>The model attempts to encompass the first two activities. There
are, however, many links to be made between all the elements in the
process of obtaining information, and these links may be expressed
reciprocally. Determining and describing the part of a link that
may be embodied in the model inevitably determines the nature of
the complementary half, though the objects at the other end may not
be described fully, or at all.</p>

<p>The list of example collections above can be categorized into
those that are collections of entities (e.g. books) or of derived
representations of entities (e.g. photographs of pieces of
sculpture) on the one hand, and those that are collections of
information about such entities. This article refers to a
collection of entities as a 'Collection' and to a collection of
information about such entities as a 'Collection-Description'.</p>

<p>Some types of Collection-Description can themselves be seen as
Collections, in this case of metadata rather than primary
information. The Creators, Producers, etc., of the secondary
Collection will not necessarily be those of the Collection it
catalogues, however. Moreover, the secondary Collection can have
its own recursive Collection-Description. This article also uses
Collection-Description to encompass both intellectually created
resources and passive assemblages of data such as those gathered by
robotic search engines.</p>

<p>The model says nothing explicit about the size of a Collection.
It is possible to envisage a Collection consisting of one Item.
Where an institution can choose between different degrees of
aggregation in determining what are its Collections, there is no
structure inherent in the model that requires or predisposes a
particular level of aggregation. The institution should base its
choices on its own pragmatic grounds, such as the level of detail
required to make explicit those elements of the
Collection-Description that the institution deems to be useful or
necessary for the purposes of resource discovery or collection
management. I.e. institutions should adopt a <i>functional
granularity</i> approach.</p>

<p>A highly simplified view of the model is presented here:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="model.gif" alt=
"RSLP Collection Description Model - simplified view"></p>

<p>Content is an intellectual creation, without reference to any
particular instantiation. Item is the concrete (incorporating
physical and electronic) realization of Content. Note that, in so
far as the model is concerned with collections, the entities
Content and Item are considered only to the extent that their types
and attributes impinge upon Collection Description. In the vast
majority of cases, too, the Items will coincide with what <i>
FRBR</i> calls Items, not Manifestations. Item has been chosen as
the most neutral term in preference to other terms which have been
used such as 'Document' or 'Document-like Object'. Item can most
easily embrace all of the concepts of physical and electronic, text
and non-text, and human and natural creations.</p>

<p>A Collection is an aggregation of physical and/or electronic
Items. A Location is the place (identified physically or
electronically) where a Collection is held. Note that it is
important to distinguish between the place and the institution
responsible for the place; the latter is represented in this model
by the term Administrator.</p>

<p>A Creator is responsible in some way for the existence of the
intellectual Content of an Item. A Producer is responsible for the
existence of the physical or electronic form in which an Item is
realized.</p>

<p>A Collector gathers Items together. An Owner is the Agent who
has legal possession of a Collection. An Administrator has
responsibility for the physical or electronic environment in which
a Collection is held.</p>

<p>The model separates Agents (Creator, Producer, Collector, Owner
and Administrator), shown on the left-hand side, from Objects (Content,
Item, Collection and Location), shown on the right. Agents are people or
organizations. Agents initiate actions, for example they create
Content, produce Items, gather Items into Collections and
administer Locations. Agents have rights. Agents can have many
roles at the same time, for example the Collector of a collection
may also be its Owner. Agents also control the usage of the
collections. They determine who has access rights to the Collection
and its Location and who holds copyright and ownership.</p>

<h4>Kinds of collection descriptions</h4>

<p>The model defines four broad classes of collection
description:</p>

<dl>
<dt><i>Unitary Finding-Aid</i></dt>

<dd>a Collection-Description which consists only of information
about the Collection as a whole and does not provide information
about the individual Items within it.</dd>

<dt><i>Hierarchic Finding-Aid</i></dt>

<dd>a Collection-Description which consists of information about
the Collection as a whole, together with information about the
individual Items within it and their Content, including contextual
information about the relation of the Items and their Content to
the Collection as a whole. Note that this type of
Collection-Description is most often associated with archival
collections where contextual information is necessary to the
understanding of the Items.</dd>

<dt><i>Analytic Finding-Aid</i></dt>

<dd>a Collection-Description which consists of information about
the individual Items within it and their Content. Note that this
type of Collection-Description is typical of a library
catalogue.</dd>

<dt><i>Indexing Finding-Aid</i></dt>

<dd>a Collection-Description that consists of information derived
from the individual Items within it.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In three of the four identified types of Collection-Description
the information conveyed is analytic:  that is, the information is
held in discrete packets (e.g. catalogue records).  Although
they may be brought together and presented as a result of a search,
or may be organized in a particular sequence (e.g. by author's
name), the packets are largely independent of each other.</p>

<p>However, two qualifications have to be made to the paragraph
above. First, a Collection-Description may have some overall
structure that reduces the autonomy of its constituent elements -
i.e. it may be necessary to know the placement of a catalogue
record within the structure of the catalogue - its context -- in
order to interpret the record correctly. This is always true to
some extent, and the participants in the Toronto conference on the
principles and development of AACR [<a href="09powell.html#ref13">13</a>] stressed the weaknesses in
online catalogues resulting from the loss for such contextual
information (for example, the ordering of results sets is often
effectively arbitrary). It is particularly true for the established
practices in cataloguing archival collections (see the rules for
multilevel description in ISAD(G) [<a href="09powell.html#ref14">14</a>]).</p>

<p>Second, with Internet resources the distinctions may become
blurred. Take, for example, the existence of a site for the works
of Kipling on the World Wide Web. Viewing the site as a whole, it
may be said to be a collection of entities or derived
representations of entities. However, if much the same list of
links can be retrieved by a search on (say) Yahoo, does this make
Yahoo a Collection in our definition instead of a
Collection-Description? We take the view that ownership,
administration and location are relevant to the definition of a
collection. The fact that a catalogue can now be directly linked to
the entities catalogued - that the searcher can move seamlessly
from finding and identifying to selecting and obtaining - need not
mean that the constituent elements of those processes have
changed.</p>

<p>A Unitary Finding-Aid takes as its basis the information about
the Collection as a whole - it makes no attempt to capture
information about individual records except in so far as it is
necessary to provide aggregate information (e.g. on limiting dates,
or on the number of Items it contains).</p>

<p>An Analytic Finding-Aid lists the individual records comprising
information about the intellectual Content and the Items in which
it is realized. There may, in the individual records, be
information about Collections, and the Finding-Aid may be
searchable from that aspect, but that is not its focus. A library
catalogue is typically an Analytic Finding-Aid.</p>

<p>An archival collection is more often described by a Hierarchic
Finding-Aid, in which the individual Items and their Content are
described, but firmly grounded within the overall arrangement of
the Collection, e.g. grouping together all the letters, account
books etc. in an ordered sequence or sequences. The Items are often
not uniquely identifiable when considered in isolation, so the
context of the Collection is an essential element in compiling the
Collection-Description.</p>

<p>An Indexing Finding-Aid is characterized here as consisting of
information derived from Items, by implication regardless of their
Content. By this is meant that an Indexing Finding-Aid - such as a
robotic search engine - will index the words in a document (or
catalogue record) regardless of their context and without trying to
identify the discrete elements of Content contained therein. The
effects of this may be mitigated by the use of metadata tags in Web
documents, but in so far as the engine uses such tags, it is
creating an Analytic Finding-Aid (which may or may not be combined
with the Indexing Finding-Aid). An online Analytic Finding-Aid may
incorporate a keyword index that is, in effect, an Indexing
Finding-Aid in this sense of the term. At the other end of the
technological scale, a printed Calendar of a Collection may have
its own printed Indexing Finding-Aid which lists, out of context,
the names, places, etc., occurring in the Collection.</p>

<h4>External relationships</h4>

<p>Because it is a model of a single instance of a Collection, the
model of Collection Description does not explicitly map external
relationships. Such relationships are between instances of the
model, and are not part of the internal structure of the model
itself. They may, moreover, operate both at the Collection level
and at the Collection-Description level. Relevant external
relationships are:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Has-Version</i> (including format distinctions; the
distinctions made in CCSDS <i>Reference Model for an Open Archival
Information System (OAIS)</i> [<a href="09powell.html#ref15">15</a>] section 5.1.3 p. 5-4 may
appropriately be used as instances of this class of
Relationship)</li></ul>

<ul><li><i>Has-Part</i> (relating parts to wholes; discussion has
identified the desirability of distinguishing Diffuse)</li></ul>

<ul><li><i>Has-Complement</i> (where a formerly unified Collection has
been split into separate parts, possibly in separate
institutions)</li></ul>

<ul><li><i>Has-Association</i> (where another Collection is relevant
but the relationship is not described by one of the above list.
Typically relates to another Collection associated with one or more
of the Agents of the Collection)</li></ul>

<ul><li><i>Has-Publication</i> (where the collection is the basis of a
published scholarly work). The associated Publication is unlikely
to be present in a Collection Description resource so this External
Relationship will not be reciprocal</li></ul>

<ul><li><i>Is-Described-By</i> (relating a Collection or
Collection-Description to a Collection-Description)</li>
</ul>

<h3>RSLP collection description schema</h3>

<p>The schema presented here is intended to facilitate the simple
description of Collections, Locations and Agents, i.e. of the
emboldened entities in the above
diagram. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>descriptive attributes about the Collection,</li></ul>

<ul><li>descriptive attributes about the Location (or Locations),</li></ul>

<ul><li>identification and/or description of three kinds of related
Agents, the Collector and Owner of the Collection and the
Administrator of the Location,</li></ul>

<ul><li>external relationships - identification of collections and
other resources that are related to the Collection being
described.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In terms of the four collection description types listed above, this schema
supports the creation of <i>Unitary Finding-Aids</i>.

<p>Note that the 'dc:', 'cld:' and 'vcard:' prefixes used in the
'RDF property' column above provide a convenient short-hand
representation for the full RDF property. See the example RDF
description listed below for full details of the RDF properties
used in RSLP collection descriptions.</p>

<p>It should be noted that, wherever possible, properties have been
taken from existing metadata schemas, notably the Dublin Core
Metadata Element Set (DCMES) [<a href="09powell.html#ref16">16</a>] and the vCard set of attributes
[<a href="09powell.html#ref17">17</a>]. The table above also indicates where a property is a
sub-property of an existing property in the Dublin Core or vCard
schema.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>


<p>The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is the W3C recommended
architecture for metadata on the Web. RDF provides a mechanism for
making simple metadata statements about resources (including both
digital and physical resources) of the form - <i>resource X has
property Y with value Z</i>. By grouping sets of these simple
statements together, and by using the same mechanism to make
statements about the sets of statements, it is possible to build up
complex RDF descriptions of multiple resources and the
relationships between them. Currently, the exchange of RDF
descriptions on the Web is achieved by encoding them using the
Extensible Markup Language (XML) [<a href="09powell.html#ref18">18</a>].</p>

<p>The RSLP Collection Description project chose to encode
collection descriptions using the XML encoding of RDF, based on the
attributes listed in the schema above. Full collection descriptions
are partitioned into separate RDF descriptions of Collections,
Locations, Collectors, Owners and Administrators. These separate
descriptions are linked together to form a full description.</p>

Chinese Books housed at the School of Oriental and African Studies
Library, London follows:</p>

          China, during his sixteen years residence in Guangzhou and Macao
          between 1807 and 1823. Ten thousand Chinese-style thread-bound
          volumes cover a broad spectrum of subjects from early and mid-Qing

<p>This encoding syntax follows the draft recommendations for
encoding Dublin Core metadata within RDF [<a href="09powell.html#ref1">19</a>] (current at the time
of development) particularly in the area of how to encode the <i>
scheme</i> associated with a particular value.</p>

<p>Notice that the RDF descriptions above are <i>about</i> resources that are
explicitly identified using a URI [<a href="09powell.html#ref20">20</a>]. In the case of
most RSLP projects however, the Collections, Locations and Agents
being described do not typically have URIs already assigned to
them. The URIs used in the above description have been
automatically generated, specifically
for the purpose of creating the description
in RDF.</p>

<p>By encoding descriptions in RDF/XML and by making use of Dublin
Core and vCard properties as far as possible, the project hopes to
position RSLP collection description very closely alongside other
emerging descriptive practice on the Web.</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>The RSLP Collection Description Project has developed a simple
Web-based tool that enables the creation and editing of fairly
complex RDF collection descriptions. The tool has a number of
example descriptions built into it and also contains embedded
detailed help in the form of data-entry guidelines for each of the
attributes.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="tool.gif" alt=
"RSLP Collection Description tool"></p>

<p>The tool is freely available for use on the Web. It has been
developed in Perl and the source code will be made available in the
near future.</p>

<p>There has been some other, more experimental, implementation of
the above schema using a relational database (Microsoft Access) and
the ROADS suite of tools [<a href="09powell.html#ref21">21</a>]. Although these implementations
cannot yet produce an RDF/XML encoding of a collection description,
there is no reason why they should not do so. This work has already
been used successfully as the basis of further implementation by
other RSLP projects and it is anticipated that further work will be
carried out in this area.</p>

<h3>Collection types</h3>

<p>Work on the project has also has also resulted in the
development of an enumerated set of collection types - terms that
may be used as a value for the collection Type (dc:type) attribute
in the above schema. The list is made up of the emboldened
categories in the left-hand column of the following table. The list
of categories are grouped into those that indicate the type of
collection, those that indicate the curatorial environment in which
the collection has been made, those that indicate the content of
the collection and those that indicate the collection policy and/or
usage.</p>

<p>In this scheme, multiple categories may be selected as
appropriate. Typically, zero or one category from each group will
be selected (though there may be exceptions to this). Multiple
categories should be concatenated together, separated by a '.', to
form a string value - for example:</p>

<p><b>Collection.Library.Dispersed</b><br>
<b>Catalogue.Museum</b><br>
<b>Finding-Aid</b><br>
<b>Collection.Archive</b><br>
<b>Index.Internet</b><br>
<b>Catalogue.Internet.Subject</b><br>
<b>Collection.Image</b></p>

<p>Although the ordering of categories implies no hierarchy, it is
suggested that categories be selected in the order shown here for
consistency.</p>

<h3>Issues and conclusions</h3>

<p>The RSLP collection description schema is not intended to be a
replacement for richer archival description schemas, such as that
offered by ISAD(G). Rather, it should be seen as a schema for
making relatively simple collection descriptions in a wide variety
of contexts - a <i>Dublin Core</i> for collection description. It
is noted that several of the current RSLP projects will be
contributing ISAD(G) conformant EAD descriptions to the UK Archives Hub [<a href="09powell.html#ref22">22</a>] (or
will be eligible to contribute descriptions to the Hub).
We have recognized that it is not sensible to ask those projects to
describe the same collections twice.
To enable RSLP projects to describe collections once, a mapping
from ISAD(G) to the RSLP collection description schema or vice
versa is necessary, allowing collection descriptions in one format
to be transformed into the other format. Mappings between ISAD(G)
and the RSLP collection description schema, and tools to automate
conversion between ISAD(G) conformant EAD and RSLP collection
descriptions encoded in RDF are likely to be generally useful,
particularly given the possibility that the RSLP collection
description schema may be used outside of the RSLP context.</p>

<p>The choice of RDF/XML as an encoding syntax has not been
entirely trouble free. RDF is a fairly new development and there is
not a great deal of significant implementation experience.
The approach taken of inventing a URI and assigning it to a resource,
specifically for the purpose of creating an RDF description, is
relatively untested.
Furthermore, recent recommendations made by the
Dublin Core Metadata Initiative for <i>element
qualifiers</i> [<a href="09powell.html#ref23">23</a>] (schemes and attribute refinements) have been developed
in parallel with our work and
the conventions for their encoding in RDF are
not yet fully mature.  The qualifiers and
syntax adopted in this area by the RSLP
Collection Description project may well be incompatible with the
conventions
developed elsewhere in the future.</p>

<p>It might be argued that the project has not had sufficient
resources to fully develop software tools that enable other RSLP
project to describe collections in a cost effective and efficient
way. This is largely true - such software development was never
envisaged as part of the original project proposal. This means that
projects, particularly those projects that need to describe large
numbers of collections, are left with the burden of developing
their own RDF collection description tools. This is made more
difficult given the general lack of off-the-shelf RDF compliant
tools. This is not an ideal situation.</p>

<p>However, the RSLP Collection Description Project has been
successful in developing a model of collections and collection
descriptions, in implementing that model using an RDF encoding and
in providing the basis for deployment of that encoding by other
RSLP projects.</p>
