Abstract</H3></font>

<Font color="#000066">An architecture to enable cross-organizational access management of
web-based resources is described.  The architecture uses digital
certificates and secure directory services to implement decoupled
authentication and authorization functions.  It improves management
information and enables more flexible service possibilities without
compromising individual privacy.</font></p>

<H3>
Introduction</H3>

<p>
Over the last year, the Digital Library Federation (<a href="11millman.html#DLF">DLF</a>) initiated a
pilot project to investigate a new architecture for networked service
provision across organizational boundaries.  The architecture,
described below, attempts to solve a longstanding problem in access
management while enabling new service possibilities.</p>


<p>
The participants in the pilot are two suppliers of networked
information, the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) and JSTOR, and
two consumer institutions, The University of California and Columbia
University.</p>

<p>
The architecture is based on existing standards: the X.509 standard
for digital certificates and the LDAP directory standard.  It uses the
former to guarantee the identity of the consumer (authentication) and
the latter to enable service provision based on the characteristics of
the consumer (authorization).  The architecture provides improved
access, privacy, efficiency, flexibility and richer management
information.  We call it the "Digital Library Authentication and
Authorization Architecture" or DLA3.</p>

<p>
Our model arose in the context of licensed information resources in
university libraries.  But it is actually quite general, and might
apply to many situations in which an organization supplying
information restricts access to particular individuals at other
organizations.</p>



<H3>Motivation</H3>

<p>
Internet information service providers typically manage access in
three ways: by establishing individual passwords, by network topology
(IP address) restrictions and, a special case of the latter, using web
"proxies."  All of these methods have significant problems.</p>


<p>
When a service provider establishes id's and passwords for individual
customers, it is often duplicating a part of an infrastructure already
in place at the customer's institution.  For example, most
universities have existing infrastructure to manage individual email
accounts, library circulation records, access to administrative
services, etc.  This infrastructure usually includes substantial
policies and processes for adding and removing individuals, and for
maintaining status information about an individual's eligibility to
access different resources.  In a university setting, the population
itself, as well as any individual's status, is especially dynamic.
While information service providers invest considerable effort to
create user accounts and passwords, it is nearly impossible for them
to accurately reflect the dynamic communities of the consumer
institutions.  Such systems are also inconvenient for individuals,
who must keep track of separate id's and passwords for each
information service they use.  And consumer institutions must rely
entirely on the service provider for any management information, as
they have no other way to measure the usage of their own community.
The principal advantage of this method is that it permits service
providers to create customized services for each individual.</p>


<p>
Access management by IP address is, of course, widespread.  In this
case, the service provider limits access to those portions of the
Internet administered by the licensing consumer institutions.  While it
was always an imprecise strategy, this method is increasingly
problematic.  Many members of consumer communities are working from
locations separate from the institution's network: at home, through
commercial Internet Service Providers (ISP's), through newer
commercial high speed dialup services.  Distance education programs
promise to make this situation even worse.  One's membership in the
institutional community has less and less to do with one's physical
location.  It is practically impossible for service providers to
create customized services for individuals, and management information
is again only available to providers, and is rather imprecise.</p>


<p>
In the proxy approach, requests to the service provider are routed
through a gateway, the proxy, located within the consumer
institution's network.  Individuals must authenticate, i.e., provide
credentials such as an id and password, to gain access to the proxy
(therefore requiring an institutional infrastructure for
authentication).  The proxy then forwards their service request to the
provider and must dynamically adjust each web page returned by the
provider before it reaches the individual's browser, editing each link
back to the provider so that the proxy remains in the path of all
transactions.  Service providers cannot create customized services and
can collect only minimal management information, because all
institutional transactions appear to come from a single address (the
proxy's).  Proxies have been traditionally difficult to program,
configure and manage.  And recently, as more service providers take
advantage of javascript and java to enhance functionality, proxies are
increasingly unable to make the required edits and thus fail to
operate at all.  Another proxy approach (sometimes called a
"mechanical" proxy) avoids the editing problem by routing all of an
individual's web requests through the proxy.  But this method
introduces other problems, including potential conflicts in browser
configuration and computational bottlenecks.</p>


<p>
These access management problems have been discussed at great length
elsewhere (<a href="11millman.html#LYNCH">Lynch, 1998</a>).  Our team sought an architecture that would
address the problems of all these traditional approaches.</p>


<p>
We met in January, 1999 in Oakland, CA.  The team developed a set of principles and a transaction protocol, defined a set of directory attributes and created an extension to
the X.509 certificate.  The
participants were Joan Gargano (University of California, Office of
the President), Ariel Glenn (Columbia University), Rebecca Graham
(Digital Library Federation), Sal Gurnani (UC), Leah Houser (OCLC),
David Millman (Columbia), Spencer Thomas (JSTOR) and Vance Vaughn
(UC).</p>




<H3>Principles</H3>

<p>
The architecture follows these principles:</p>


<p>
<em>Privacy.</em> No information identifying an individual to the
service provider need be exchanged.  But, for any particular set of
information resources, different degrees of anonymity may be used.
For example, "pseudoanonymous" identity may be appropriate, in which a
provider can tell if the same person visits more than once but cannot
tell who they are (e.g., "user1234"), or certain demographic data may
be exchanged in appropriate circumstances.  In the default case, the
service provider knows only that the individual is an authorized
member of the consumer institutional community.  Any further
information about the individual must be explicitly negotiated: either
chosen by the individual and/or agreed to in advance between the
service provider and the consumer institution.</p>


<p>
<em>Partitioning of information.</em> As far as is possible, both the
consumer institution and the service provider should hold information
over which they have primary responsibility, respectively.  Redundant
information should be minimized.  For example, if a service provider
offers a service customized for each individual, it should arrange for
exchange of pseudoanonymous identity with the consumer institution
rather than attempt to duplicate institutional id systems.  Or, if a
consumer institution subscribes to a number of different sets of
services from the same service provider it should arrange for the
establishment and exchange of a service class identifier with the
service provider, encoding the sets of services (i.e., using a
"serviceName", described below).</p>


<p>
<em>Separation of Authentication and Authorization.</em>  An individual's
membership in an institutional community should not, in itself, imply
what particular services are permitted.  For example, alumni and
faculty may have access to quite different sets of resources.  Also,
as mentioned, an individual's status and capabilities may change over
time.  This architecture requires that authentication be performed through
a digital certificate and that authorization be performed through a
distinct transaction with an authorization (or "attribute") server.</p>

<p>

<H3>Transaction Model</H3>

<p>
Under this architecture, a transaction would proceed as follows:</p>


<p>
<center></p>

<p>
<img src="fig1.gif"></p>

<p>
<strong>Figure 1.  Transaction model.</strong></center></p>



<p>
Note that the dashed line represents an organizational administrative
boundary, and not a physical or network topological boundary.</p>


<p>
<ol>
<p><li> An individual within the consumer institutional community requests
information from a remote service provider.  Establishing the SSL
(encrypted session) network connection, the individual's digital
certificate is sent by the browser.  The service provider validates
the individual's certificate.</li></p>


<p><li> The service provider extracts information from the individual's
certificate, and uses it to locate the institution's authorization
server, contact it and request the status of the individual.
Establishing this secure connection requires that the service provider
present its own certificate to the authorization server.</li></p>


<p><li> The authorization server checks the validity of the service
provider's certificate.  If valid, it returns attributes concerning
the individual's status with respect to this service provider back to
the provider in the form of a list of attribute names and values.</li></p>


<p><li> From the authorization server's response, the service provider
decides to either deliver the service or an error message back to the
individual.</li></p></ol></p>




<p>
In the first part of the transaction, the service provider must act on
two key components: the validity of the certificate received and the
ability to initiate the authorization process.  Our assumptions for
the former were that there be mutual agreement on the contents of, at
least, the "Issuer" field of the certificate and that certificates
will be issued in accordance with acceptable Certificate Practice
Statements (<a href="11millman.html#CREN">CREN 1999</a> and <a href="11millman.html#VERISIGN">Verisign 1998</a>, for example).  In our pilot,
both of the consumer institutions acted as their own Certificate
Authority (CA) and so, for the pilot, agreement on the Issuer field
alone was sufficient.  When the consumer institution does not act as
its own CA, Issuer in combination with another certificate field can
accomplish the same goal.  (Precisely which other certificate field is
still under discussion.)</p>


<p>
The authorization process begins as the service provider extracts an
X.509v3 extension field from the individual's certificate, the "Query
URL."  This extension field was developed for this architecture and is
registered with ISO under the administration of the Council on Library
and Information Resources, parent organization of the Digital Library
Federation (see <a href="11millman.html#APPENDIX">Appendix</a> for details).  This URL should be
either an LDAPS (secure directory lookup) or HTTPS (secure HTTP)
format.  Our pilot used LDAPS exclusively and has defined a result
format for LDAPS only.  Aside from this level of protocol, the rest of
the Query URL should be considered opaque by the service provider.
The Query URL must contain enough information to identify the
individual requester to the authorization facility but, as mentioned
above, the service provider should not presume to discover this
identity by inspection of the Query URL.  For example, temporary
random identifiers might be used in the Query URL to identify the
individual.</p>


<p>
Because the operations use secure network protocols, the service
provider and the authorization facility must also possess server
certificates.  In the same way the individual delivered their
certificate to the service provider originally, so the service
provider delivers its certificate to the authorization facility.
Using the provider's certified identity, using the "Issuer" and
"Subject" fields, the authorization server can adjust the query result
per provider, returning only appropriate information previously agreed
upon.</p>


<p>
Authorization is implemented by associating a set of attributes to
each institutional user.  The most critical is the repeatable
attribute "Service Class."  Each institutional user will probably have
a number of Service Class attributes.  We define Service Class as an
ordered triple.  The fields of Service Class are currently
human-readable strings for convenience.
A Service Class is:</p>


<ul>
<p><li>
<em>vendorName.</em>  This should uniquely map to a service provider.</li></p>

<p><li>
<em>serviceName.</em> This is intended to distinguish among sets of
services that may be offered by the same service provider.  For
example, in our pilot the consumer institutions subscribed to several
different packages of services from OCLC, while JSTOR offered only a
single service.</li></p>


<p><li>
<em>serviceType.</em>  Intended to specify the individual's level of access
to the particular service.  For example, library staff will have
different access from undergraduates for the same service.  Again from
our pilot: JSTOR provides the same level of access for all
institutional individuals, while for OCLC this field was an account
code.
</li></p>
</ul>


<p>
It was clear that vendorName should correspond uniquely to each
service provider, and that this mapping will be used to insure that
service providers will only be presented with Service Classes
pertaining to themselves (i.e., one provider may not see Service Class
values for other providers).  It is our hope that serviceName and
serviceType are sufficiently flexible to accommodate a wide variety of
access possibilities.</p>


<p>
In any case, the service provider receives the Service Class
information from the authorization facility and decides whether or not
to deliver the service requested by the individual, based on the
serviceName, serviceType and on the consumer institution.</p>


<p>
In addition to the Service Class(es) for the individual, the
authorization facility also may deliver these attributes:</p>


<p>
<ul>

<p><li>
<em>Statistical Role.</em> To provide necessary management
information, this field will be supplied by the consumer institution
and will be used by the service provider as an aggregation key for
statistical reporting to the consumer institution.  It is not
precisely defined by this architecture but should be negotiated and
mutually agreeable.  We strongly recommend conformance to the
guidelines set forth by the International Consortium for Library
Consortia (<a href="11millman.html#ICOLC">ICOLC, 1998</a>).</li></p>

<p><li>
<em>Persistent Identifier.</em> To enable individual-based services and
state information of individuals for the use of service providers, this identifier must be unique within the consumer institution
population.  Its precise format and lifetime are not defined here, but
it must never be mappable to any public identifier for an individual.
This suggests a hashed value, such as MD5.</li></p>


<p><li>
<em>Access Denied Message.</em>  In cases where the service provider
cannot deliver its own appropriate error message to the requesting
individual, this field should be sent.  Again, its format is not
yet defined.</li></p>

</ul></p>

<p>

Other attributes may be returned to the service provider as well 
(demographic information, for example).  The precise set of attributes
delivered must be negotiated in advance.</p>


<p>
This model may dramatically improve the acquisition of management
information for both the service provider and the consumer
institution -- in the former case, by providing appropriate attributes
and in the latter, by analysis of the authorization server traffic.</p>



<H3>Public Key Infrastructure Issues</H3>

<p>
This process doesn't address the way in which an individual obtains an
appropriate certificate in the first place and how they install that
certificate into their browser.  Methods vary, depending both on the
browser itself and on the public key infrastructure and procedures in
place at the consumer institution.  This is a critical requirement but
is of a larger scope and should be addressed independently from this
architecture.</p>

<p>
Two distinct kinds of certificate management are implied by this
architecture, for servers and for individuals.</p>


<p>
As mentioned, in order to operate secure network connections, service
providers and authorization servers must possess certificates.  The
number of such certificates is relatively small, perhaps only one or
two per organization.  Methods for obtaining such certificates and for
establishing peer to peer trust for this application appear to be
straightforward and reasonably priced.</p>


<p>
Establishing a public key infrastructure for individuals at large
institutions is much more complex, involving legal and policy work in
addition to the technology changes.  And it may have a significant
financial impact.</p>


<p>
Distribution of individual certificates raises a number of issues,
such as portability (e.g., home vs. office) and manipulation of
multiple certificates for different purposes (e.g., university
services vs. banking services).  Shared workstations are common in
higher education and pose particular distribution problems.  And
current browsers have relatively poor certificate manipulation
interfaces.</p>


<p>
While this architecture may be considered an early, cutting edge
application of PKI, it is entirely consistent with the efforts of
Educause (<a href="11millman.html#EDUCAUSE">Educause 1999</a>), CREN, and the federal government (<a href="11millman.html#NIST">NIST, 1998</a>) to
promote standards-based inter-organizational secure communications.</p>

<H3>Future Work, Next Steps</H3>

<p>
We believe our pilot has successfully proven this architecture can
work from a technical point of view.  But a number of items need more
clarification before this model can move into a scalable production
setting.  And there are a few open issues.</p>
 

<p>
Formal specifications and procedures must be in place so that this
model can be integrated into licensing negotiations between service
providers and consumer institutions.  Agreement on the precise
contents of certificate fields and procedures to communicate changes
in certificate hierarchy are needed.</p>


<p>
As mentioned, the Statistical Role, Persistent Identifier and Access
Denied Message have not been sufficiently defined.  These elements
need to be tested further, and must eventually become part of the
service provider licensing negotiation process.  It is also possible
for an individual to have multiple Statistical Roles or multiple
Service Classes for the same service, although it is not clear how
these cases should be handled.</p>


<p>
Certificate revocation is not discussed here, and is relevant in the
larger PKI context.  For individuals' certificates, our model can
implement this function informally by simply denying access to such
individuals in the authorization process.</p>


<p>
We have not specified any particular caching guidelines.  It appears
reasonable that caching should happen per individual "session" and not
for every transaction.  Caching would, of course, affect traffic
analysis measures and so should be designed carefully and described
clearly.</p>


<p>
As mentioned, attributes returned by the consumer institution's
authorization server are currently defined only for LDAPS protocol
query/response.  We have not designed or tested an HTTPS (secure HTTP)
transaction but believe this to be an important alternative.  We
presume, in this case, the attributes and values would be encoded in
XML.</p>


<p>
It takes considerable labor at the consumer institution to implement
an authorization service.  Enterprise-wide high-performance directory
infrastructures are relatively new and appear primarily at large
research institutions.  These infrastructures are an important
investment, independent of this particular application.  But to
quickly make use of this architecture it may be more straightforward
for an institution to begin with the HTTPS alternative.  We would like
to extend our pilot in this direction as soon as possible.</p>


<p>
Our decision to use LDAPS made sense functionally: it is designed to
return attribute-value pairs.  But only the most recent
implementations support secure connections and the use of certificates
for authentication. Some custom programming was necessary.  Using
HTTPS would eliminate portions of that effort.</p>



<p>
While still a work in progress, this architecture has made substantial
headway toward a more secure, private, accurate and at the same time a
more flexible access management framework.  Organizations interested
in participating in these next steps should contact Rebecca Graham at
the Digital Library Federation.</p>
