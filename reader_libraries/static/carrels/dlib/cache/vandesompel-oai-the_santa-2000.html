 <H3><FONT color=#000066>Abstract</FONT></H3>  
<P><FONT color=#000066>The Open Archives initiative (OAi) promotes and encourages the development of author self-archiving solutions (also commonly called e-print systems) through the development of technical mechanisms and organizational structures to support interoperability of e-print archives. Such interoperability can stimulate the transition of e-print systems into genuine building blocks of a transformed scholarly communication model. This paper describes the Santa Fe Convention of the OAi. This is a set of relatively simple but potentially quite powerful interoperability agreements that facilitate the creation of mediator services. These services combine and process information from individual archives and offer increased functionality to support discovery, presentation and analysis of data originating from compliant archives.</font></P>  

<H3>Introduction</H3>  

<P>In July 1999, Paul Ginsparg, Rick Luce and Herbert Van de Sompel sent out a <A href="http://www.openarchives.org/ups-invitation-ori.htm">Call for Participation</A> (<A  href="02vandesompel-oai.html#ref6">Ginsparg, Luce, and Van de Sompel 1999a</A>) to a meeting exploring cooperation among scholarly e-print archives. The <A   href="http://www.openarchives.org/ups1-press.htm">meeting</A>,&nbsp; held in   October 1999 in Santa Fe, and originally called the Universal Preprint Service   meeting, led to the establishment of the <A  href="http://www.openarchives.org/">Open Archives initiative</A> (OAi) (<A   href="02vandesompel-oai.html#ref7">Ginsparg, Luce, and Van de Sompel 1999b</A>). The goal of the OAi is to contribute in a concrete manner to the transformation of scholarly communication.&nbsp; The proposed vehicle for this transformation is the definition of technical and supporting   organizational aspects of an open scholarly publication framework on which both free and commercial layers can be established.</P>

<P>This paper describes the origins of the OAi and work    heretofore in defining this framework: the <A href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe Convention</A>.  This convention is a combination of organizational principles and technical    specifications to facilitate a minimal but potentially highly functional level    of interoperability among scholarly e-print archives. The convention gives <I>data providers</I> -- individual archives -- relatively easy-to-implement mechanisms for making information in their archives externally available. This external availability then makes it possible for <I>service providers</I> to build higher levels of functionality, <I>mediator services</I>, using the information made available from scholarly archives that adopt the convention. </P>  

<H3>The growth of e-print archives </H3>  

<P>The origins of the Open Archives initiative lie in the growing number of electronic preprint (e-print) archives. While several of these began as informal vehicles for the dissemination of preliminary results and non-peer reviewed "gray literature", a number of them have evolved into an  essential medium for sharing research results among the colleagues in a field. </P>

  <P>These archives demonstrate a shift in the traditional scholarly communication model, which has relied on formally published scholarly    journals. There is a growing consensus that the scholarly journal system is facing significant challenges:</P>  

<UL>    
<P><LI>The explosive growth of the Internet has given scholars almost universal access to a communication medium that facilitates immediate sharing of results.</li></p>    
<P><LI>The rapidity of advances in most scholarly fields has made the slow turn-around of the traditional publishing model an impediment to collegial sharing.</li></p>
<P><LI>The full transfer of rights from author to publisher often acts as an impediment to the scholarly author whose main concern is the widest dissemination of results.</li></p>    
<P><LI>The current implementation of peer-review -- an essential feature of scholarly communication -- is too rigid and sometimes acts to suppress new ideas, favor articles from prestigious institutions, and cause undue publication delays.</li></p>     
<P><LI>The imbalance between skyrocketing subscription prices and shrinking or, at best, stable library budgets is creating an economic crisis for research libraries. </li></p> 
</UL>  

<P>The e-print archives exemplify a more equitable and efficient model for disseminating research results. An important challenge is to increase the impact of the e-print archives by layering on top of them services -- such as peer review -- deemed essential to scholarly communication. This is the focus of the Open Archives initiative. </P>  

<P>An exhaustive review of existing e-print archives is out of the scope of this paper. An interesting list of initiatives is available at the <A href="https://www.osti.gov/eprints/ppnbrowse.html">Office of Scientific and   Technical Information</A>. A brief review of some of the notable efforts is   illustrative of the scope of these initiatives:</P>  

<UL>    

<P><LI><A href="http://www.arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</A>, hosted by Los Alamos     National Laboratory, is considered the premier example<B> </B>of e-print     archives. The archive was started in 1991 by Paul Ginsparg, who is     internationally recognized as one of the leaders in the area of scholarly     publishing alternatives. Over the past decade, the <A     href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</A> archive has evolved towards a global     repository for non peer-reviewed research papers in a variety of physics     research areas. arXiv has also incorporated mathematics, non-linear sciences     and computer science.</LI></P>     

<P><LI><A href="http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/">CogPrints</A>, hosted by the     University of Southampton in the U.K., is modeled on arXiv and focuses mainly     on papers in Psychology, Linguistics and Neuroscience.</LI></P> 

<P><LI><A href="http://www.ncstrl.org/">NCSTRL</A> (Networked Computer Science     Technical Reference Library) is an international collection of computer     science research reports. NCSTRL is based on a distributed model. Documents are stored in distributed archives and are made available through distributed services that communicate via the <A     href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/NCSTRL/protocol.html">Dienst</A> protocol.</LI></P>     

<P><LI><A href="http://www.ndltd.org/">NDLTD</A> aims at building a digital     library of electronic theses and dissertations (ETD) authored by students of     member institutions. In ongoing research, NDLTD addresses issues such as the     creation of a workflow to submit ETDs, the development of an XML DTD for ETDs     and the support of a digital library for ETDs.</LI></P>     

<P><LI><A href="http://netec.mcc.ac.uk/RePEc/">RePEc</A>, an initiative in     economics, also operates on a distributed model. It provides authors with the option to submit working papers to a <A     href="http://ideas.uqam.ca/ideas/archives.html">departmental archive</A> or --     if one does not exist -- to the <A href="http://wuecon.wustl.edu/">EconWPA</A>     archive at Washington University. These archives support the so-called <A     href="http://netec.mcc.ac.uk/RePEc/GuilP.html">Guildford</A> protocol that     guarantees interoperability between the RePEc archives and has enabled the     creation of <A href="http://ideas.uqam.ca/ideas/services.html">a variety of     end-user services</A>. </LI></P>
</UL>  

<P>There are indications that a growing number of disciplines and organizations   are inspired by this pioneering work and are investigating alternative models   for scholarly communication: </P>  

<UL>    
<P><LI>The NIH <A     href="http://www.nih.gov/welcome/director/pubmedcentral/ebiomedarch.htm">e-biomed</A> proposal (<A href="02vandesompel-oai.html#ref18">Varmus 1999</A>) for a more effective communication system for research reports in the life sciences demonstrates the innovative thinking inspired by initiatives like arXiv. While the <A     href="http://www.nih.gov/welcome/director/pubmedcentral/pubmedcentral.htm">PubMed Central</A> environment (<A href="02vandesompel-oai.html#ref1">Anonymous 1999</A>) (the system being developed as the outcome of the proposal) is more conservative than e-biomed, it remains faithful to the original desire to provide barrier-free access to primary reports in the life sciences.</LI></P>     

<P><LI>The British Medical Journal and HighWire Press recently launched <A     href="http://clinmed.netprints.org/">Clinical Medicine Netprints</A> (<A     href="02vandesompel-oai.html#ref5">Delhamothe, et al. 1999</A>), an e-print site for studies, research, and articles in Clinical Medicine.</LI></P>     

<P><LI>Under the umbrella of the <A     href="http://www.cdlib.org/eschol/">eScholarship</A> project, the California     Digital Library is working on University ePub (<A href="02vandesompel-oai.html#ref13">Lucier and Ober 1999</A>), a set of disciplinary e-print servers and services whose overall     aim is to lead and support innovations in the production and dissemination of     scholarship. The project received one of the grants from <A     href="http://www.arl.org/SPARC/">SPARC</A> in the context of its <A     href="http://www.arl.org/SPARC/sci.html">Scientific Communities     Initiative</A>, which called for proposals introducing alternative     communication methods as a way to address the serials crisis.</LI></P>     

<P><LI>MIT plans to build a digital repository of which all public e-prints will     be available to the whole e-print community.</LI></P>     

<P><LI>Caltech's <A     href="http://library.caltech.edu/publications/scholarsforum/">Scholar's     Forum</A> (<A href="02vandesompel-oai.html#ref4">Buck, Flagan, and Coles 1999</A>) describes an alternative conceptual model for scholarly communication. </LI></P>
</UL>  

<H3>From individual archives to an interoperable fabric</H3>  

<P>The aim of the archive initiatives described above is to try to create a more effective scholarly communication mechanism that addresses problems that exist in the established system. The approaches that are taken by individual archives differ in a number of ways. Some initiatives build on a centralized model, others on a distributed departmental, or by extension, institutional model. Some deal with gray (non-peer reviewed) literature only, others incorporate metadata of peer-reviewed papers or try to establish some form of peer-review outside of the established system. Some deal with metadata only, others with both metadata and full content. Yet all share the attribute of offering scholars a vehicle to conveniently and immediately disseminate research results to peers. </P>  

<P>The reason for launching the Open Archives initiative is the belief that interoperability among archives is key to increasing their impact and establishing them as viable alternatives to the existing scholarly    communication model. This conviction is expressed in the official mission    statement of the initiative:</P>  

<P><I>The Open Archives initiative has been set up to create a forum to discuss   and solve matters of interoperability between author self-archiving solutions   (also commonly referred to as e-print systems), as a way to promote their global   acceptance. </I></P>  

<P>Interoperability is a broad term, touching many diverse aspects of archive initiatives, including their metadata formats, their underlying architecture, their openness to the creation of third-party digital library services, their integration with the established mechanism of scholarly communication, their usability in a cross-disciplinary context, their ability to contribute to a collective metrics system for usage and citation, etc.</P>  

<P>Interoperability among archives offers substantial benefits to the scholars that use them. An important attribute of the traditional research library as an information provider is its role as a common entry point for a variety of information resources, not necessarily divided along disciplinary or institutional boundaries. The move from physical to digital sources should not be accompanied by the breakup of this entry point into a collection of fragmented archives. An increasing number of scholars move fluidly in their research across domain boundaries; the technology for delivering digital information should facilitate rather than hinder such fluidity. Mechanisms for interoperability offer the potential for discovery tools and virtual collections (<A href="02vandesompel-oai.html#ref11">Lagoze, 1998</A>) that extend across the contents of multiple archives. Authors also benefit from such archive spanning tools, since their works will be accessible by a wider audience.</P>  

<P>Interoperability is also beneficial to the archive and service provider. Rather than having to provide an entire suite of services for its users, individual archives can instead establish a well-defined interface on which external providers can build enhanced services. A variety of such services can be envisioned, including those that facilitate discovery, linking, and reviewing. An intriguing and essential set of services would be those that provide metrics to assist in the evaluation of the impact of certain scholarship and aid in tenure review and promotion decisions.</P>  

<P>The Sante Fe Convention of the OAi represents a pragmatic, incremental, and collaborative approach towards interoperability. The initiators of the Open Archive initiative hope that this practical approach will be a catalyst for significant changes in the mechanisms for scholarly communication. The need for such change has been the issue of numerous papers, workshops, and Internet discussion groups. Yet, the existing system has proven somewhat resistant to change, no doubt due to the complex socio-political and economic forces that support it. For example, the current system of academic promotion and tenure is closely linked to the traditional journal system (<A href="02vandesompel-oai.html#ref19">Wilson 1942</A>). This acts as an important factor sustaining the existing communication model (<A   href="02vandesompel-oai.html#ref15">Schauder 1994</A>). Understandably, scholars are hesitant to support alternative models that are not yet linked to their evaluation and promotion. While such issues will continue to support the current system, the development of practical technical and organizational solutions, such as the Sante Fe Convention, builds a framework for changes that will inevitably occur and may encourage the implementation of those changes.</P>  

<P><strong>Agreeing on interoperability: the Santa Fe meeting of the Open Archives initiative</strong></P>    

<P>A successful first meeting of the initiative was held on October 21-22, 1999, in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The meeting was sponsored by the Council on Library and   Information Resources (CLIR), the Digital Library Federation (DLF), the   Scholarly Publishing &amp; Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC), the Association   of Research Libraries (ARL) and the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The   <A href="http://www.openarchives.org/ups-participants.htm">participants</A> were   computer scientists and digital librarians. There were also representatives of   existing and emerging e-print systems, of scholarly publishers and of the   sponsors. All but one of the invited institutions sent a representative. This   was considered to be a firm indication of the perceived importance of the   initiative.</P>  

<P>The central theme of the first meeting was the establishment of   recommendations and mechanisms to facilitate cross-archive value-added   services. Such services could combine information derived from cooperating   archives, process that information to produce some value-added information, and   make that enhanced information available to users, agents, or other services. Examples of such services include cross-archive search engines, current awareness services, linking systems, and peer-review services.</P>  

<P>Achieving progress on this goal required agreement among the participants on   the issue of interoperability. Although interoperability has been   a watchword for a variety of efforts in digital libraries and networked   information (<A   href="02vandesompel-oai.html#ref14">Paepcke, Chang, et al. 1998</A>), the actual meaning of it and the implementation thereof has often proven elusive. Like many meetings intended to reach agreement on standards, attendees at the Santa Fe meeting arrived with a variety of pre-conceived notions on what was required to reach interoperability. It is instructive to review how these differing notions converged into a well-defined agreement that provides the foundation for cross-archive exchange of information.</P>  

<P>The meeting began with a rather expansive example of interoperability,   illustrated through the UPS Prototype project coordinated by Herbert Van de   Sompel, Thomas Krichel, and Michael Nelson. This project and its results are described at length in the companion paper (<A href="02vandesompel-oai.html#ref17">Van de Sompel,   Krichel, Nelson, et al 2000</A>). Briefly summarized, the prototype demonstrated   the integrated operation of a variety of services operating over data   originating from a set of archives. Each of those services provided a reasonably   rich level of functionality (implemented through a set of protocols).</P>  

<P>There was general agreement among the participants at the meeting that the Prototype was an extremely useful demonstration of potential. There was also agreement, however, that trying to reach consensus on the full functionality of the Prototype was "aiming too high" and that a more modest first step was in order. The Prototype team, based on their insights gained during implementation of the UPS prototype, also reached a similar conclusion. This is described more fully in "<A   href="../vandesompel-ups/02vandesompel-ups.html#upsrecom">Recommendations made to the Open Archive group</A>" of (<A   href="02vandesompel-oai.html#ref17">Van de Sompel, Krichel, Nelson, et al. 2000</A>).</P>  

<P>The remainder of the meeting was engaged in determining the proper degree of    modesty, which balanced the need for adequate functionality against the requirement    that the cost of entry for participating archives be sufficiently low. This is a question that has bedeviled other efforts at interoperability; for example, buy-in to the highly functional<A href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/z3950/agency/"> Z39.50</A> protocol has largely been limited to libraries, due to the costs of complexity (<A href="02vandesompel-oai.html#ref16">Stubley 1999</A>). An important step towards establishing the cost/functionality balance was reached by the beginning of the second day with agreement among the participants on a tiered model of interoperability. This model is illustrated in <A href="02vandesompel-oai.html#oai1">Figure    1</A>, showing the following layers:</P> 

<UL>   
<P><LI><I>Document Models</I> - that address document structure and allow the specification of multiple disseminations (e.g., in multiple formats or of various structural decompositions) of a document instance. One example that addresses this level of interoperability is the <A     href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/cdlrg/dienst/protocols/DienstProtocol.htm">Dienst</A> repository protocol.</LI></p>     

<P><LI><I>Metadata Harvesting</I> - that enables the extraction of descriptive surrogates for documents. This approach was effectively demonstrated by the Harvest project (<A href="02vandesompel-oai.html#ref3">Bowman 1995</A>) several years ago.</LI></p>     

<P><LI><I>Mediator Services </I>- that describe the nature of services that use and enhance information available from archives. The UPS Prototype (<A     href="02vandesompel-oai.html#ref17">Van de Sompel, Krichel, Nelson, et al 2000</A>) demonstrated a number of these services (e.g., linking) that build on top of the metadata harvesting layer. This service layer is also described in the digital library service model of (<A href="02vandesompel-oai.html#ref12">Leiner 1998</A>).</LI></p>
</UL>  

<P align=center><IMG border=0 height=244   src="sfc1.gif"   width=480></P>  
<P align=center><B><A name=oai1></A>Figure 1: a tiered model of interoperability</B></P>  

<P>Framing the problem of interoperability with this model quickly led to the decision to restrict the Santa Fe recommendations to interoperability at the   level of <I>metadata harvesting</I>. The mechanisms for establishing this   interoperability, described in full detail in the <A   href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe Convention</A> and   summarized in the remainder of this paper, are three-fold:</P>  

<OL>    

<P><LI>The definition of a set of simple metadata elements -- the <A     href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_oams.htm">Open Archives Metadata     Set</A> (OAMS) -- for the sole purpose of enabling coarse granularity document     discovery among archives;</LI></P>     

<P><LI>The agreement to use a common syntax, XML, for representing and     transporting both the OAMS and archive-specific metadata sets;</LI></P>     

<P><LI>The definition of a common protocol -- the <A     href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/cdlrg/dienst/protocols/OpenArchivesDienst.htm">Open Archives Dienst Subset</A> -- to enable extraction of OAMS and archive-specific metadata from participating archives. </LI></P>
</OL>  

<P>This agreement treats documents as black-boxes; archives can have   idiosyncratic document representations with the <A   href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe Convention</A>   only specifying a URL entry point to the archives' individual document models. The question and functionality of common mediator services   are left open to implementers who wish to exploit the <A   href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe Convention</A> and   build mechanisms based on it.</P>  

<H3>The Santa Fe Convention</H3>  

<H4><B><I>Objective</I></B></H4>  

<P>The <A href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe Convention</A> presents a technical and organizational framework designed to facilitate the discovery of content stored in distributed e-print archives.    It makes easy-to-implement technical recommendations for archives that –- when    implemented –- will allow data from e-print archives to become widely available    via its inclusion in a variety of end-user services such as search engines,    recommendation services and systems for interlinking documents. In addition,    the convention introduces an organizational framework for making information    available about archives that adhere to the technical recommendations of the    convention -- the <i> data providers</i> -- and about trusted parties that build    end-user services for data originating from such archives -- the <i> service    providers</i>. As such it provides a communication mechanism between providers    of data and providers of services and creates a community of open archives.</P>  

<H4><B><I>Definitions and Concepts</I></B></H4>  

<P>The <A href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe   Convention</A> builds on on a number of definitions and concepts that are   essential for its understanding.</P>  

<P><strong>Open and managed e-print archives</strong></P> 

<P>The Convention considers the following to be crucial components of an e-print archive:</P> 

<UL>   
<P><LI>A submission mechanism;</li></p>    

<P><LI>A long-term storage system;</li></p>   

<P><LI>A management policy with regard to submission of documents and their preservation;</li></p>   

<P><LI>An open machine interface, that enables third parties to collect data from the archive.</li></p> 
</UL>  

<p>The last item is crucial for enabling third parties to create services that    support the discovery, presentation and analysis of data in the archive. Most    e-print archives will also provide native end-user services. However, facilitating the broad dissemination of archive data through third party services is a crucial feature of an e-print archive. Therefore, the open interface is a key part of the Santa Fe Convention.</p> 

<P><strong>Data providers and service providers</strong></P>  

<P>Consistent with the objective of the <A   href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe Convention</A> and   the identification of the crucial functions of an e-print archive, there is a   distinction between two participants in the convention:</P>  

<UL>    
<P><LI>A <I>data provider</I> is the manager of an e-print archive, acting on     behalf of the authors submitting documents to the archive. As pointed out     above, the data provider of an open archive will, at least, provide a     submission mechanism, a long-term storage system and a mechanism that enables     third parties to collect data from the archive;</LI></p>     

<P><LI>A <I>service provider</I> is a third party, creating end-user services     based on data stored in e-print archives. For instance, a service provider     could implement a search engine for mathematical e-prints stored in archives     worldwide.</LI></p> 
</UL>  

<P><strong>Data in an e-print archive</strong></P>  

<P>The convention uses the notion of a <I>record</I> in an archive. Some   archives may store metadata that describes full content without storing the full   content itself. In this case, the metadata is a <I>record</I>. Other archives may also store full content. However, the convention assumes that if full content is stored, there will always be associated metadata stored in the archive as well as a mechanism to tie metadata and content together. In this   case the combination of metadata and full content is a <I>record</I>.</P>  

<H4><B><I>Technical Components of the Santa Fe Convention</I></B></H4>  

<P>The complete details of the technical components of the <A   href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe Convention</A> and   instructions for participating are available via the <A   href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc.htm">core document</A>.   Organizations considering participation should refer to that document. This   section summarizes the information for the purpose of an overview.</P>  

<P><strong>Open Archives Metadata Set</strong></P>  

<P>The <A href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_oams.htm">Open Archives Metadata Set</A> (OAMS) is a collection of nine metadata elements intended to facilitate coarse granularity resource discovery among the records in distributed and dissimilar archives. The semantics of this set have  purposely been kept simple in the interest of easy creation and widest applicability. There is no provision for qualification or extension of the nine elements. The   expectation is that individual archives will maintain metadata with more   expressive semantics and the <A   href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/cdlrg/dienst/Protocols/OpenArchivesDienst.htm">Open Archives Dienst Subset</A> provides the mechanism for retrieval of this richer metadata.</P>  

<P><strong>Open Archives Dienst Subset</strong></P>  

<P>The <A   href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/cdlrg/dienst/protocols/OpenArchivesDienst.htm">Open Archives Dienst Subset</A> is a set of protocol requests that are delivered via HTTP. This protocol is a subset of the full <A   href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/cdlrg/dienst/protocols/DienstProtocol.htm">Dienst protocol</A>. The protocol requests in the subset provide the following   functionality:</P>  

<UL>    

<P><LI>List the full identifiers for records stored in an archive. An     optional argument permits the client to specify that the list should only     include records added after a specific date. Another optional argument     allows the client to specify that the records should be accompanied by the     metadata associated with the identifier.</LI></P>     

<P><LI>Return the metadata for a specific record in a requested format.</LI></P>     

<P><LI>Return the list of metadata formats supported by an archive.</LI></P>     

<P><LI>Return the list of metadata formats available for a specific record.</LI></P>     

<P><LI>Return the structure of the partitions by which an archive is organized.     </LI></P></UL>  

<P>All responses to these requests are formatted in XML.</P>  

<H4><B><I>Organizational aspects of the Santa Fe Convention</I></B></H4>  

<P>The convention also introduces an organizational framework to facilitate its   implementation and to establish a communication mechanism between data providers   and service providers. An understanding of this framework can be obtained from   an exploration of the <A href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc.htm">core   document</A> of the <A   href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe Convention</A>   that gives a step by step approach for making an e-print archive or a service   comply with the Santa Fe Convention.</P>  

<P>For the data providers, some of these steps are directly related to the   implementation of the technical recommendations of the convention, as summarized   in the previous section. In addition, the core document introduces the following   important organizational elements:</P>  

<UL>    
<P><LI>The notion of a <I>unique archive identifier </I>to unambiguously     represent each e-print archive, as well as the notion of a <I>full     identifier</I> of a record in an archive. Since this <I>full identifier</I> is     a concatenation of the unique archive identifier and the unique persistent     identifier of a record in an archive, this <I>full identifier</I> will be     persistent and globally unique.</LI></P>     

<P><LI>The recommendation to document metadata formats other than the OAMS, as     well as a <A     href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_metadata.htm">facility</A> to share     this documentation with data providers and service providers.</LI></P>     

<P><LI>A facility to register an e-print archive as being compliant with the <A     href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe Convention</A>,     by means of the provision of a filled-out version of a <A     href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/data_provider_template.htm">data     provider template</A> that describes crucial characteristics of the archive.     Important information to be provided in this template is the <I>unique archive     identifier</I>, the metadata formats implemented by the archive and URLs of     the Dienst interface of the archive. The template also provides a means to     provide information on the content of an archive, its submission policy and     contact addresses. In addition, the template gives data providers a means to     express the terms and conditions of usage of archive data.</LI></P>     

<P><LI>A <A href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_archives.htm">list</A> of     e-print archives that comply with the <A     href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe Convention</A>,     from which links are available to the documents describing their crucial     characteristics. </LI></P>
</UL>  

<P>For the service providers, the steps described in the <A   href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc.htm">core document</A> of the <A   href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe Convention</A>   introduce the following:</P>  

<UL>    
<P><LI>The request to maintain the original <I>full identifiers</I> of the     records harvested by the service provider.</LI></P>     

<P><LI>The request to comply with the terms and conditions that data providers     have brought forward in their filled-out <A     href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/data_provider_template.htm">data     provider template</A>.</LI></P>     

<P><LI>A facility to register a service as being compliant with the <A     href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe Convention</A>,     by means of the provision of a filled-out version of a <A     href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/service_provider_template.htm">service     provider template</A> that describes aspects of the service. Amongst others,     the service provider must mention from which archives information is being     harvested as well as the fact that harvesting is compliant with the terms and     conditions expressed by the data providers.</LI></P>     

<P><LI>A <A href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_services.htm">list</A> of     services that comply with the <A     href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe Convention</A>,     from which links are available to the filled-out templates that describe them.     </LI></P>

<H3>Conclusions and future plans</H3>  

<P>The technical results of the Santa Fe meeting may be perceived as quite modest, and indeed they are. However, the technical moderation should be viewed in a broader context. First, it played an important role in bringing the Santa Fe meeting to a successful conclusion, with agreement among diverse parties. This agreement amongst a core group is an important step towards the development of a broader e-print community with a strong focus on cooperation and interoperability. The organizational framework provided by the <A   href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe Convention</A> is   intended to actively contribute to the creation and extension of such a   community. Second, the limited nature of the technological requirements lowers   the cost of entry for new participants, and hopefully builds momentum for the   development of scholarly publishing alternatives. This momentum will provide a basis for future agreements that may extend and enhance the current <A   href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe Convention</A>.</P>  

<P>If successful, the Convention will attract early adoption by existing archives and encourage the establishment of new scholarly archives that will support the mechanisms defined by the Convention. The former, early adoption, seems to be occurring with participants at the meeting representing <A   href="http://www.arxiv.org/">arXiv</A>, the <A   href="http://www.cdlib.org/">California Digital Library</A>, <A   href="http://clinmed.netprints.org">clinmed</A>, <A   href="http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/">CogPrints</A>, <A   href="http://netec.mcc.ac.uk/RePEc/">RePEc</A> and <A   href="http://www.ncstrl.org/">NCSTRL</A>, <A   href="http://www.arxiv.org/"></A>stating their intention to comply with the <A   href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe Convention</A> in   the near future.The CogPrints team at Southampton also work on the   implementation of a free software for e-print archives that will comply with the   <A href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe   Convention</A> (<A   href="02vandesompel-oai.html#ref8">Harnad 1999</A>).  Based on the number of inquiries received since the Santa Fe meeting, there are reasons to be optimistic regarding the establishment and adoption by other existing and planned archives. Positive feedback has been received from representatives of German mathematical and physical e-print archives. In addition, several commercial and non-commercial parties have expressed interest in creating mediator services once archives have implemented the   convention.</P>  <P>The current challenge for the Open Archive initiative is to maintain a focus on the successful dissemination and implementation of the <A   href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe Convention</A>.    Before considering whether it is necessary or appropriate to expand the nature    of the interoperability agreements, it is essential that the mechanisms described in the current convention be widely implemented and tested in practice. Without such proof of concept, the initiative may find itself increasing the complexity (and cost of implementation) of the interoperability mechanisms without discovering if, in fact, the level of interoperability defined by the existing <A href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe Convention</A>    is sufficient and practical. Any future work to expand the scope of the OAi should understand that the success of any interoperability standard must be measured relative to both its functionality and its cost of adoption (<A   href="02vandesompel-oai.html#ref2">Arms 2000</A>).</P>  

<P>The near-term plans for the Open Archive initiative include public   dissemination of the <A   href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa Fe Convention</A>   scheduled for February 15, 2000, and meetings to review progress and chart   future activities. This paper represents the initial public dissemination   and the Open Archives <A href="http://www.openarchives.org/">web site</A> will   serve as a persistent and official record of the convention. The next   meeting will take place at <A href="http://www.dl00.org/">ACM Digital Libraries 2000</A> in San Antonio, Texas, in June 2000. The exact dates and place of this meeting will   be posted on the Open Archives web site nearer to the June date. A   European meeting is tentatively planned in conjunction with <A   href="http://www.ibl.pt/org/agenda/ecdl2000/">ECDL 2000</A> in Lisbon, Portugal, in September 2000.<B><I> </I></B></P>
