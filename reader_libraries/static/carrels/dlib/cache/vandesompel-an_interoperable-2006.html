This article describes an interoperability fabric among a wide variety of heterogeneous repositories holding managed collections of scholarly digital objects. These digital objects are considered units of scholarly communication, and scholarly communication is seen as a global, cross-repository workflow.  The proposed interoperability fabric includes a shared data model to represent digital objects, a common format to serialize those objects into network-transportable surrogates, three core repository interfaces that support surrogates (obtain, harvest, put) and some shared infrastructure.  This article also describes an experiment implementing an overlay journal in which this interoperability fabric was tested across four different repository architectures (aDORe, arXiv, DSpace, Fedora). We detail the implementation choices made in the course of this experiment.

<H3>1. Introduction and Motivation</H3>

<p>
Two years ago, in an opinion piece for <i>D-Lib Magazine</i>, we described our vision of a natively digital scholarly communication system enabled by an interoperable infrastructure with a wide variety of heterogeneous repositories as its foundation [<a href="10vandesompel.html#1">1</a>].  We described an infrastructure that would leverage the value of the digital objects hosted by those repositories by making them accessible for use and re-use in many contexts.  In this infrastructure, repositories are not static components in a scholarly communication system that merely archive digital objects deposited by scholars.  Rather, they are the building blocks of a global scholarly communication federation in which each individual digital object can be the starting point for value chains.  Hence, scholarly communication itself is regarded a global workflow or value chain across repositories, with digital objects from repositories being the subjects of the workflow. 
</p>

<p>
This view of scholarly communication raises a variety of intriguing prospects and associated questions across the whole social-economic-legal-technical spectrum. The Pathways project funded by the US National Science Foundation focuses on the technical problem domain, thereby identifying the components required to facilitate the emergence of a natively digital, repository-based scholarly communication system.  The research goal is to find the appropriate level of cross-repository interoperability that will provide the technical basis to realize the vision, and will stand a realistic chance of being implemented in existing and future repository systems.
</p>

<p>
Our vision was inspired by the observation that the established scholarly communication system has not kept pace with the revolutionary changes that are occurring in scholarly research practices.  A significant amount of scholarly communication has been brought into the digital realm. However, we argue that various properties of its paper-based ancestor were taken for granted in the transition, and were not challenged or revised in light of the fundamentally new capabilities offered by the digital, networked reality.  
</p>

<p>
Citation provides an obvious example of the possibility to rethink scholarly communication.  In today's scholarly communication system, citation means including some textual information describing a cited paper at the end of the citing paper.  These textual citations included in a digital manuscript are not natively machine-readable or machine-actionable.  
</p>

<p>
Various post-factum approaches have been devised to connect citing and cited papers by means of hyperlinks in the Web environment.  These approaches include fuzzy metadata-based citation matching [<a href="10vandesompel.html#2">2</a>], the DOI-based CrossRef linking environment [<a href="10vandesompel.html#3">3</a>], and the OpenURL framework for context-sensitive linking [<a href="10vandesompel.html#4">4</a>,<a href="10vandesompel.html#5">5</a>].  The varying quality of citation metadata is just one of several reasons that the results of these approaches are less than perfect.   Furthermore, these approaches are not easily extended into the realm of compound digital objects that contain datasets, simulations, visualizations and so forth.   
</p>

<p>
How should we rethink citation in a natively digital scholarly communication system?  We think of citation as a particular type of re-use of the cited digital object in the context of the citing digital object. Imagine being able to drag a machine readable representation of a digital object hosted by one repository, and to drop it into the citing object that, once finalized, is ingested into another repository.  Now imagine being able to do the same for the citing object, etc.  Assuming that the machine-readable representations being dragged and dropped contain the appropriate properties, the result would be a natively machine-traversable citation graph that might span repositories worldwide.  
</p>

<p>
There are numerous other examples in scholarly communication of workflows across distributed repositories.  These include the mirroring of digital objects for preservation purposes, the creation of repositories that host virtual collections of objects that are physically hosted in other repositories, the progression of units of scholarly communication through the registration-certification-awareness-archiving chain [<a href="10vandesompel.html#1">1</a>], and the re-use of datasets hosted by various repositories for the creation and publication of a new dataset. In order to enable such workflows, participating repositories will need some common interface to the world.  Determining the nature of this interface is the subject of our Pathways explorations, and this article reports the insights that we have gained thus far. 
</p>

<p>
The remainder of this article is structured as follows. In Section <a href="10vandesompel.html#sec-2">2</a>, we introduce the core concepts of the Pathways interoperability infrastructure.  In Section <a href="10vandesompel.html#sec-3">3</a>, we describe the choices that were made for the concrete implementation of these concepts to support an overlay journal workflow scenario. In Section <a href="10vandesompel.html#sec-4">4</a>, we describe the overlay journal environment and workflow.  For a more detailed overview of the work reported, we refer to our recent paper "Pathways: Augmenting interoperability across scholarly repositories" <a href="10vandesompel.html#6">[6</a>].
</p>

<h3><a name="sec-2">2</a>. Overview of the Pathways Interoperability Infrastructure</h3>


<p>
Our work exploits the expanding number and variety of heterogeneous repositories that hold managed collections of digital objects.  We propose that the digital objects from these repositories can function as the units of scholarly communication in cross-repository workflows, and can also provide the raw materials for the creation of a variety of cross-repository services. In accordance with the rapidly emerging scholarly reality, we consider these digital objects to be compound in nature. That is, they are aggregations of datastreams with both a variety of media types and a variety of intellectual content types including papers, datasets, simulations, software, dynamic knowledge representations, machine readable chemical structures, etc.

<b>Table 2: Core components of the interoperability layer provided by repositories.</b>
</p>

<h4>2.1 The foundation of multiple levels of interoperability</h4>

<p>
Recall that the goal of the Pathways research is to identify the minimum level of interoperability to support cross-repository information re-use.  The proposed interoperability fabric based on surrogates and three focused interfaces does not preclude other more advanced levels of interoperability. For example, surrogates could be used in conjunction with other public repository services and end-user applications.  Also, the three core repository services need not necessarily be limited to surrogates only.  
</p>

<p>
The harvest and put services could support other structured formats, in the manner that OAI-PMH [<a href="10vandesompel.html#9">9</a>] supports multiple metadata formats. The obtain service could support a wide variety of services pertaining to an identified digital object and its constituent datastreams. The potential of defining such a rich service environment focused around a specific digital object was the motivation for distinguishing between the harvest and obtain services.  Rich levels of the obtain functionality have been explored in the context of the aDORe project [<a href="10vandesompel.html#11">11</a>,<a href="10vandesompel.html#12">12</a>] and examples of service requests include obtaining a surrogate for an identified journal article, obtaining a PDF datastream of that same article, obtaining an audio version of the article by applying a text-to-speech transformation upon the PDF datastream, etc. 
</p>

Finally, the proposed Pathways Core data model (and its compliant surrogates) contains only those properties that we consider absolutely necessary.  The model allows extensions to the core that would facilitate higher levels of interoperability that might be required by some communities, applications, and workflows.  

<h4>2.2. Example of the infrastructure in a workflow</h4>

<p>
Figure <a href="10vandesompel.html#fig-2">2</a> shows the core components of our proposed infrastructure in the context of an example workflow.  At the left hand side, it shows two source repositories, each with a contained digital object.  The repositories have obtain interfaces from which a surrogate for each digital object can be requested.  These surrogates are then submitted to the put interface of a target repository.  After this put operation, a variety of repository and workflow-specific operations can take place, and, eventually a new digital object results in the target repository.  A surrogate for this new digital object can then be obtained from the target repository.
</p>

<p>
Figure <a href="10vandesompel.html#fig-2">2</a> also illustrates the concept of lineage. Lineage makes it possible to automatically record an audit trail (or evidential citation) for scholarly workflows within the fabric of the digital scholarly communication system.  This audit trail would allow tracking back from any given digital object to its ancestors in the workflow that resulted in its creation. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, the figure also emphasizes the importance of digital object identity in the interoperability framework.  Indeed, if we want to allow access to surrogates and recording of audit trails, then identification of digital objects is crucial.  We observe that identification mechanisms as they are frequently used in scholarly communication (e.g., DOI) allow multiple copies of an identified object stored in different repositories to share the same identifier.  This level of identification granularity is sufficient for current citation purposes. However, it is inadequate for recording an audit trail of a cross-repository value chain, which needs identity expressed at the granularity of copies of digital objects <a name="fig-2">in</a> specific repositories.

<h3><a name="sec-3">3</a>. Components of the Infrastructure</h3>

<p>
The result of our work thus far is a prototype interoperability fabric.  This prototype reflects design choices made in the context of the overlay journal prototype described in Section <a href="10vandesompel.html#sec-4">4</a>.  We expect that a number of these choices will be revisited and may need to change in order to transition this prototype to a true interoperability specification.  The remainder of this section describes the aspects of this design.</p>

<h4><a name="sec-3.1">3.1</a> A common data model for representing digital objects. </h4> 


<p>
We have designed and experimented with a data model we call the Pathways Core [<a href="10vandesompel.html#6">6</a>,<a href="10vandesompel.html#13">13</a>].  Figure <a href="10vandesompel.html#fig-3">3</a> shows a UML diagram of the model, and an OWL schema (encoded in XML) is included in <a href="10vandesompel.html#appendix-b">Appendix B</a>.  The data model shares some characteristics with existing compound object models, such as MPEG-21 Digital Item Declaration [<a href="10vandesompel.html#10">10</a>].  It uses nested entities to represent recursive "digital objects within digital objects", it allows the association of multiple properties with entities, and uses the <i>hasDatastream</i> property to provide access to entities' constituent datastreams.  We note that our current approach only allows by-reference inclusion of datastreams via providing their network locations (URL). Therefore, workflows and services that require or desire actual transfer of the constituent datastreams will need to (selectively) dereference these URLs after harvest, obtain or put.
</p>

<p>
The manner in which we model access to datastreams raises a number of questions. Can datastreams be delivered by-reference (as in our current approach), by-value (the datastream embedded within the surrogate) or both?   Or to put it differently: should surrogates be shallow or deep copies of a digital object, or can they be both?   Perhaps the answer lies in the notion of "levels of interoperability" described earlier.  Consequently, should support for shallow copies be the minimally required level? 
</p>

<p>
At the time of writing, even the authors of this article actively debate these questions.  We are in agreement that a shallow copy approach has the advantage of pushing potential intellectual property rights issues pertaining to datastreams outside of the core interoperability fabric.  From related work at JISC [<a href="10vandesompel.html#14">14</a>], we are starting to understand the complexities involved in an interoperable solution to support putting deep copies into repositories.   And we point out that not all value chain scenarios require the transfer of all datastreams of a digital object.  Mirroring for digital preservation is a notable example of the need for <a name="fig-3">a</a> "deep copy" capability.  
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="vandesompel-fig3.jpg" width="680" height="369" alt="Diagram of the Pathways Core model"><br><br>
<b>Figure 3: UML diagram of the Pathways Core data model.</b>
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, there is no disagreement about the need for clear notions of identity and lineage in the model. They are essential for recording workflows, which we argue are central to our process-oriented approach to scholarly communication.  Historically, identifiers have been a source of considerable debate.  We argue that it is unrealistic to propose an interoperable fabric that mandates the use of specific identifier schemes.  Therefore, our design supports the use of URIs that conform to a variety of schemes and the use of these URIs in the following aspects of the data model:

	<li>The <i>hasIdentifier</i> property supports the association of one or more URIs with a digital object.  An example of this type of identification is the DOI for a journal article that can be associated with multiple copies of the same article hosted in various repositories.</li>
	<li class="spacetop">The <i>hasProviderInfo</i> property supports a relatively simple, repository-centric identifier paradigm, which permits precise identification of a digital object in a particular repository, facilitating re-use and accurate audit trails.  providerInfo is a triple consisting of:</li></ul>
<ul class="level2b">
	<li><i>provider</i> - This is the identity of the repository. We assume that the participants in this infrastructure &#150; institutional repositories and the like &#150; have a commitment to their repository identity. Indirection via a repository identifier, instead of its network location, presumes a service registry for registering repositories and for discovering the location of their public service interfaces. This is discussed later in Section <a href="10vandesompel.html#sec-3.4">3.4</a>.</li>
	<li class="spacetop"><i>preferredIdentifier</i> - This is the identity of the entity within the repository. It serves as the key for making service requests against the identified digital object (represented by the entity) at the obtain service of the repository. As already explained, the core obtain request is for a surrogate of the digital object. We emphasize that the syntax, semantics, and resolution of the hasProviderInfo identity are local to the individual repository, rather than being global as in more ambitious identifier schemes.  Typically, it is expected that the value of the preferredIdentifier would be one of the values of the hasIdentifier property, but this is not a requirement.</li>
	<li class="spacetop"><i>versionKey</i> - This is a means of parameterizing a service request on a digital object according to version semantics supported by the individual repository. </li>
</ul>





<p>
The <i>hasLineage</i> property expresses that a digital object is the result of a workflow that includes other originating digital objects. The value of this property for an entity is the hasProviderInfo identity of the entity (or entities) from which the new entity derives, thus expressing both the origin repository of the source object, its identity within that repository, and its version semantics. Repositories should maintain the lineage chaining when they create a new digital object in response to a put request, thereby maintaining a record of the workflow across repositories. To do this, they should record the providerInfo of a put surrogate, and subsequently include it in the hasLineage information of any surrogates of the new digital object.   
</p>

<p>
We note that attaching a hasProviderInfo property to an entity makes the entity available for re-use in other contexts.  This is because hasProviderInfo is an unambiguous identity for the entity; it contains all essential keys to obtain a surrogate for the entity from the origin repository.  Since the model is recursive &#150; entities can contain entities &#150; re-use of sub-entities is enabled. A new entity can be the result of a workflow that originates in sub-entities of other entities, as long as such sub-entities have a hasProviderInfo property. Which (sub-)entities will be made available for re-use is expected to be the subject of best practices at the level of repository systems and scholarly communities. 
</p>

<h4>3.2 A format for serializing digital objects as surrogates</h4> 

<p>
We use RDF/XML to represent and transmit Pathways Core surrogates of digital objects. Table 4 in <a href="10vandesompel.html#appendix-a">Appendix A</a> shows a surrogate for the digital object from arXiv with identifier info:arxiv/astro-ph/0301029v3; Figure <a href="10vandesompel.html#fig-4">4</a> shows a graphic representation of that surrogate.   In the illustrated surrogate, the digital object corresponds to the root entity element, shown in the Figure as the "article" circle at the left top.  The details of this example are as follows:
</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>The hasIdentifier property of this entity is the native (arXiv) identifier of the digital object.  </li>
	<li class="spacetop">The hasProviderInfo property is the repository-centric identity of the entity.  It contains an identifier for the arXiv repository expressed using the info:sid/ URI scheme [<a href="10vandesompel.html#15">15</a>], and an identifier of the represented object from arXiv that coincides with the identifier provided in hasIdentifier. The example does not make use of the optional versionKey of the providerInfo triple.  </li>
	<li class="spacetop">The hasDatastream property contains access information (location and format) for a constituent datastream of this digital object.</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Also shown are two properties that were not previously mentioned.  hasSemantics is used to convey, via a URI, the content-type of the object (article). And providerPersistence indicates the level of commitment of the provider of the surrogate regarding delivery of surrogates for this same object in the future; in this case, the provider commits to persistent delivery of a surrogate.  </li>
	<li class="spacetop">The root entity has a sub-entity, which represents a dataset.  Although this entity does not have a hasIdentifier property, it does have a providerInfo identity, making this sub-entity available for re-use: an autonomous surrogate can be requested <a name="fig-4">for</a> this sub-entity.  </li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3 Three core repository services</h3>

<p>
<b>obtain</b> &#150; As argued by Bekaert [<a href="10vandesompel.html#12">12</a>], the OpenURL Framework Standard [<a href="10vandesompel.html#16">16</a>] provides a suitable platform for the concrete definition of an obtain service.  The OpenURL ContextObject submitted to an obtain service would at least consist of Descriptors for:
</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>A Referent &#150; The digital object that is the target of an obtain request. </li>
	<li class="spacetop">A ServiceType &#150; The service that is requested for the digital object. In the core interoperability framework there is only one service; that which generates a surrogate for the digital object. Higher interoperability levels might define other services.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is interesting to note that the OpenURL Standard allows for the inclusion of other ContextObject entities, such as the Requester, hence offering the potential for a context-sensitive obtain service environment.
</p>

<p>
Because of this flexibility we used OpenURL for the implementation of the core obtain service in the overlay journal prototype. Once a surrogate has been retrieved, say through incremental harvesting, all information needed to construct a future obtain request to retrieve a fresh surrogate is contained in the providerInfo triple (provider, preferredIdentifier, versionKey) of the surrogate itself.  The resolution of this triple into a surrogate works as follows (see Figure <a href="10vandesompel.html#fig-5">5</a>):
</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>The provider value of the triple is used as the key for a look-up in the service registry that records the network location of (at least) the three core interoperable service interfaces.  The result of this look-up is the location of the obtain interface for the repository identified by the provider value.</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Once the location is known, an OpenURL-based service request can be constructed with the remaining values from the providerInfo triple.  Table <a href="10vandesompel.html#table-5">5</a> in <a href="10vandesompel.html#appendix-c">Appendix C</a> shows the syntax <a name="fig-5">of</a> these requests.</li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><img src="vandesompel-fig5.jpg" width="640" height="353" alt="Image showing obtain as a repository-centric identifier-to-surrogate resolution mechanism"><br><br>
<b>Figure 5: Obtain as a repository-centric identifier-to-surrogate resolution mechanism.</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>harvest</b> &#150; A harvest service allows collecting batches of surrogates of digital objects. It could be implemented using various technologies such as the OAI-PMH [<a href="10vandesompel.html#9">9</a>], RSS [<a href="10vandesompel.html#17">17</a>], Google Sitemaps, or with a subset of more elaborate technologies such as SRU/W [<a href="10vandesompel.html#18">18</a>].  We believe that harvest should include a facility that allows some forms of selective collecting.  The simplest, and perhaps most useful, form of selective collecting is to allow downstream applications to harvest surrogates only for those digital objects that were created or modified after a given date.  This echoes the OAI-PMH, a well-established harvesting technology within the digital library community.  We thus chose to use OAI-PMH for the overlay journal prototype, and each participating repository implemented an OAI-PMH-based harvest service with the following properties:
</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>The service was exposed at the same baseURL of existing OAI-PMH interfaces; the existing OAI-PMH identifiers were used.</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Support for a new metadata format, the surrogate format, with metadataPrefix "pwc.rdf" was implemented.  A simple XML Schema (see <a href="10vandesompel.html#appendix-d">Appendix D</a>) was created to allow transportation of an RDF/XML metadata format via the OAI-PMH.</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Exposed metadata records were RDF/XML surrogates compliant with the Pathways Core data model.  One record was made available for each digital object in the repository. Each record was the result of a dynamic serialization of an object as a Pathways Core surrogate.</li>
	<li class="spacetop">The OAI-PMH datestamp of a surrogate was set to change whenever a change to an object or to its properties resulted in a change of its RDF/XML surrogate metadata.</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Only the ListRecords verb was used when harvesting from the repository. </li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>put</b> &#150; The put interface facilitates interoperable transmission of surrogates from a source repository to one or more target repositories.  In our current shallow-copy implementation of surrogates, a put operation can be understood as a <i>request for deposit</i> of a digital object. The put interface, in combination with a surrogate, is intended as a means for transmitting just enough information to enable a receiving repository to make decisions on how to process a surrogate &#150; without anticipating or assuming an underlying repository's requirements for ingest.  The Atom Publishing Protocol [<a href="10vandesompel.html#19">19</a>] or SRU Record Update [<a href="10vandesompel.html#20">20</a>] could be considered for the implementation of the put service.  In the overlay journal prototype, a simple HTTP POST was used.  
</p>

<h4><a name="sec-3.4">3.4</a> Shared infrastructure</h4>

<p>
A service registry is fundamental to the interoperability framework, as it facilitates locating the core service interfaces of participating repositories. This registry has the identifier of a repository (provider from providerInfo) as its primary key, and at minimum stores the actual network location of the obtain, harvest and put services. Thus, given a surrogate with providerInfo (provider, preferredIdentifier, versionKey), it is possible for an application to use provider as a look-up key in the service registry and then retrieve the location of the core service interfaces for the repository identified by provider. Once this information is available, actual service requests can be issued against those interfaces (see Figure <a href="10vandesompel.html#fig-5">5</a>). 
</p>

<p>
It should be noted that, in contrast to other repository federation approaches such as ADL-R <a href="10vandesompel.html#21">[21</a>], aDORe [<a href="10vandesompel.html#22">22</a>], CORDRA [<a href="10vandesompel.html#23">23</a>], and the Chinese Digital Museum Project [<a href="10vandesompel.html#24">24</a>], the proposed framework does not require a registry of all digital objects from all contributing repositories in order to locate a digital object given its identifier. As shown in Figure <a href="10vandesompel.html#fig-5">5</a>, the Pathways approach achieves locating a digital object by a combination of:
</p>


<ul type="disc">
	<li>The self-identifying property of surrogates &#150; the surrogate for a digital object carries its own providerInfo.</li>
	<li class="spacetop">A service registry &#150; the service registry allows locating, amongst others, the obtain service of the repository hosting the digital object by means of the provider value of providerInfo.</li>
	<li class="spacetop">The repository-centric identifier resolution &#150; The obtain interface of the repository hosting the digital object is responsible for the resolution of the preferredIdentifier (and optionally versionKey) value of providerInfo.</li>
</ul>


<p>
We believe that this approach has a better chance of remaining scalable as the number of digital objects in the environment grows over time.
</p>



<p>
One candidate technology for the service registry is the JISC Information Environment Service Registry (IESR) specification [<a href="10vandesompel.html#25">25</a>], which has been implemented by both MIMAS in the UK and by the Ockham project in the USA.  OAI-PMH, SRU and OpenURL interfaces to service registry records are available for both implementations.  An alternative approach would be to follow the concepts of service autodiscovery in which clues about the location of service interfaces are embedded in HTML pages [<a href="10vandesompel.html#26">26</a>].  Since the environment of the overlay journal prototype was rather small, a lightweight, ad-hoc implementation of the service registry was deployed.  
</p>

<p>
In addition to this lightweight service registry, we used information from PRONOM [<a href="10vandesompel.html#27">27</a>] to build a format registry. Collaborating repositories used identifiers from this registry as the values for the format property that can be attached to datastreams in surrogates.  Also, an ad-hoc list of coarse granularity scholarly content types (see <a href="10vandesompel.html#appendix-e">Appendix E</a>) expressed as info URIs [<a href="10vandesompel.html#28">28</a>] was shared across collaborating repositories; terms from the list were used as values for the semantic property that can be attached to entities in surrogates.</p>

<h3><a name="sec-4">4</a>. The Overlay Journal Prototype
</h3>

<p>
An overlay journal is a journal that does not publish any original articles, but rather selects articles that exist elsewhere, adds certain value to the selection, and publishes the result as a service to its user base.  In our prototype, "Ed", the editor of the overlay journal, sets out to create a new journal issue.  Ed doesn't go about his job in the usual manner in which he might copy the URL of the user interface pages that provide access to the selected articles, copy some bibliographic information from those pages that describe those articles, and paste it all into his overlay journal system.  Instead, Ed follows the Pathways workflow approach, moving surrogates for the objects he is interested in from their hosting repositories and submitting those surrogates to his own Overlay Journal repository.  In doing so, he moves machine-readable structured representations of actual digital objects around, not snippets of their HTML splash-page representation. 
</p>

<p>
The exact nature of the processes in the Overlay Journal repository that result from putting surrogates are outside of the scope of the interoperability framework. Actions might include dereferencing some or all of the constituent datastreams referenced by the source surrogates (for example, at least the bibliographic metadata datastream), addition of some datastreams, properties and/or structure as required by the target repository environment, etc.  Of special importance for the establishment of an audit trail of the workflow that produced the new journal issue is the recording of the providerInfo of the source surrogates.  This information can then be used as values for the hasLineage property in the surrogates that will eventually be available for this new journal issue digital object. 
</p>
	
<p>
The remainder of this section describes the environment that was deployed for the experiment, and then provides a sequential summary of Ed's workflow.  
</p>

<h4>4.1 The overlay journal prototype environment</h4>

<p>
The overlay journal experiment occurred in the February-April 2006 timeframe.  A distributed environment was deployed on systems at Cornell University, HP, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The components were as follows:
</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>Four different repository systems were represented in the experiment: aDORe [<a href="10vandesompel.html#22">22</a>], DSpace [<a href="10vandesompel.html#29">29</a>,<a href="10vandesompel.html#30">30</a>], Fedora [<a href="10vandesompel.html#31">31</a>,<a href="10vandesompel.html#32">32</a>], and arXiv. Fedora provided the platform for Ed's Overlay Journal repository; it supported the put and obtain interfaces.  The other repositories were used as the sources for materials that could potentially be included in Ed's new journal issue; they supported the harvest and obtain interfaces. The core repository interfaces were implemented as described in the previous section.</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Microsoft's Live ClipBoard [<a href="10vandesompel.html#33">33</a>] functionality was used to bridge between the repositories' obtain and put services and their user interfaces.  Microsoft's Live ClipBoard allows copy/paste of structured information (surrogates in this case) between Web applications by interacting with Web services that underlie the Web pages (the repositories' obtain and put services in this case).  Figure <a href="10vandesompel.html#fig-6">6</a> illustrates the correspondences between Pathways obtain/put and LiveClipBoard copy/paste.  In addition to this, at the user interface level, functionality was provided to obtain a surrogate, as well as to request a graph representation of it from a visualization overlay service (see below). </li>
	<li class="spacetop">An ad hoc implementation of the service registry listed the network location of the core repository services as supported by the repositories involved.  An OAI-PMH accessible format registry based on PRONOM data was introduced, and the semantic registry was a simple list of semantic identifiers shared by all repositories (see <a href="10vandesompel.html#appendix-e">Appendix E</a>).</li>
	<li class="spacetop">To illustrate how the proposed interoperability fabric enables the emergence of cross-repository functionality, the following two overlay services were implemented:</li>
</ul>

<ul class="level2b">
	<li>A service capable of visualizing surrogates based on the WebDot platform [<a href="10vandesompel.html#34">34</a>].  This was implemented as an OpenURL Application that received as input the providerInfo triple of the surrogate that was to be visualized.  This application used the value of the provider of that triple as a look-up in the service registry to find the location of the obtain service for the surrogate's origin repository, obtained a surrogate from that service, and then produced a visualization of it.  </li>
	<li class="spacetop">A full-text search engine based on the Nutch platform [<a href="10vandesompel.html#35">35</a>].  This search engine was populated by harvesting surrogates from aDORe, DSpace and arXiv. It then de-referenced the URLs for those datastreams contained in harvested surrogates that had semantic identifiers indicating that the content type of the datastream was a journal article.  At the user interface level, this search engine also supported the functionality to obtain, copy (via Microsoft's Live ClipBoard), <a name="fig-6">and</a> visualize surrogates.</li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><img src="vandesompel-fig6.jpg" width="640" height="269" alt="Chart showing how the surrogate is obtained via MS Live Clipboard copy"><br><br>
<b>Figure 6 : In the user interface, obtaining a surrogate is achieved via Microsoft's Live Clipboard copy, putting a surrogate by Live Clipboard's paste.</b>
</p>

<h4>4.2 The Overlay Journal workflow</h4>

<p>
A movie of the overlay journal workflow is available from the <a href="http://www.open-video.org/details.php?videoid=10100">Open Video Project</a> (MPEG-4, size 59.80 Mb; QuickTime, size 90.30 Mb) and from <a href="http://www.infosci.cornell.edu/pathways/av/dlib_oct2006.mov">the Pathways web site</a> (QuickTime, size 90.30 Mb). This movie demonstrates the workflow that Ed follows to create a new issue for his overlay journal in a heterogeneous repository environment empowered by the Pathways interoperability fabric. A storyboard for the movie is as follows: 
</p>

<ol type="1" start="1">
	<li>At the outset of the movie, Ed faces the (quite bare) user interface provided by his Overlay Journal repository (Fedora) for the creation of a new journal issue.  The interface shows four Live ClipBoard's scissors that are connected with Fedora's put interface.</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Then, Ed remembers having seen an interesting paper in arXiv.  He points his browser at arXiv's search interface, conducts a search there, and eventually ends up on the splash-page of the paper of interest.  This page has three icons to access surrogate-related functionality.  </li>
	<li class="spacetop">Ed explores these icons from right to left.  By clicking the RDF icon he obtains a surrogate for the arXiv object; he actually even looks at the RDF/XML!  By clicking the graph icon, he requests a representation of the surrogate from the Webdot-based visualization service.</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Via this graph representation, Ed explores the surrogate.  We can see it represents the same object as that of Figure <a href="10vandesompel.html#fig-4">4</a>.  Some properties have been made actionable.  For example: clicking the format identifier of the datastream returns an appropriate record from the PRONOM registry, and clicking the provider identifier from providerInfo returns the corresponding service registry record.  Eventually, Ed also clicks the dataset sub-entity of the surrogate and in doing so retrieves an autonomous surrogate for it.</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Ed returns to the arXiv interface, and uses Live ClipBoard to obtain/copy a surrogate. He then navigates back to the interface of his Overlay Journal and pastes the surrogate there.  	</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Ed proceeds towards his favorite Nutch-based search engine, conducts a search there, obtain/copies surrogates for 2 articles in the result list (one from DSpace and one from aDORe), and pastes them into his Overlay Journal interface. 	</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Next, Ed puts the 3 pasted surrogates into the Fedora Overlay Journal repository.  The repository eventually responds that a new journal issue digital object has been created, and it presents Ed with the option to visualize a surrogate (from the Fedora obtain service) for it. 	</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Ed gladly obliges, and is presented with a rather complex looking visual.  Still, it clearly shows the journal issue entity at the top left, and 3 sub-entities, one per article that was selected.	</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Ed now goes on to explore this visual by clicking on two of the sub-entities, thereby requesting &#150; from the Fedora obtain service &#150; surrogates for them.  The first sub-entity is a representation of the source aDORe object as ingested into Fedora, the second of the source arXiv object as ingested into Fedora (see also Figure <a href="10vandesompel.html#fig-7">7</a>).  In both cases, Ed focuses on the lineage of these entities.  	</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Actually, because the lineage has been made actionable, Ed can navigate away from Fedora, and obtain surrogates for the source article digital objects (from aDORe and arXiv) that are <a name="fig-7">at</a> the origin of the journal issue digital object.  	</li>
</ol>

<h3>5. Conclusion</h3>

<p>
This article has shown that it is possible to build scholarly value chains across heterogeneous, distributed repositories by introducing an interoperability fabric consisting of a shared data model for the representation of digital objects, a format to serialize digital objects into surrogates compliant with that data model, three core repository interfaces (obtain, harvest, put) that support surrogates, and some shared infrastructure.  And, through the introduction of a repository-centric identification approach combined with a lineage concept, it has also shown that it is possible to record audit trails of scholarly value chains into the very foundation of the scholarly communication system.  
</p>

<p>
This work reflects growing interest in the notion of repository federation. Related work such as the CORDRA effort, the Chinese DSpace Federation, and the Dutch DARE project also suggest that object re-use across various contexts is achievable through the introduction of a shared interoperable layer. The recent "Augmenting Interoperability" meeting [<a href="10vandesompel.html#36">36</a>], which was supported by the Mellon Foundation, Microsoft, the Coalition for Networked Information, the Digital Library Federation and the Joint Information Systems Committee further demonstrates the growing interest in leveraging the intrinsic value of scholarly digital objects beyond the borders of the hosting repository.  
</p>

<p>
We believe that interest in this type of federation is sufficiently strong to move beyond prototypes and to support an effort to formally specify this next level of interoperability across repositories. Such an effort would help realize the vision of a natively digital, repository-centric scholarly communication system. Through the support of the Mellon Foundation a two-year international initiative to define this interoperability fabric has started in October 2006. The initiative is aptly named <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/">Object Reuse and Exchange</a> (ORE), and it is coordinated by Carl Lagoze and Herbert Van de Sompel. In the same manner that work on the OAI-PMH began, this initiative will start with the appointment of an international advisory board and technical committee.

&lt;schema xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
        xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
        targetNamespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"

        attributeFormDefault="unqualified"&gt;
&lt;annotation&gt;
&lt;documentation&gt;
Schema to allow inclusion of RDF in OAI-PMH responses. This schema simply
defines the root element (rdf:RDF) and then says that the contents should
have 'lax' validation (i.e. no schema required). Use this by including
the following in the root element:
&lt;rdf:RDF
  xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;
  xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#
  http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/rdf.xsd&quot;&gt;

  &lt;element name="RDF" type="rdf:rdfType"/&gt;
  &lt;complexType name="rdfType"&gt;
    &lt;annotation&gt;
&lt;documentation&gt;Content may be in any namespace (namespace=##other, see
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#declare-openness) and
the elements are only validated if a schema is available that
uniquely determines the declaration (processContents=&quot;lax&quot;, see
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#declare-openness)
&lt;/documentation&gt;
    &lt;/annotation&gt;
    &lt;sequence&gt;
