<H3>Introduction</H3>

<p>The National Science Foundation's (NSF) National Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education Digital Library (NSDL) program<sup><font size=-2><a href="11zia.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> comprises a set of projects engaged in a collective effort to build a national digital library of high quality science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) educational materials for students and teachers at <strong>all</strong> levels, in both formal and informal settings. By providing broad access to a rich, reliable, and authoritative collection of interactive learning and teaching resources and associated services in a digital environment, the NSDL will encourage and sustain continual improvements in the quality of STEM education for all students, and serve as a resource for lifelong learning. Though the program is relatively new, its vision and operational framework have been developed over a number of years through various workshops and planning meetings [<a href="11zia.html#1">1-6</a>]. The NSDL program held its first formal funding cycle during fiscal year 2000 (FY00), accepting proposals in four tracks: <strong>Core Integration System, Collections, Services, and Targeted Research</strong>. Twenty-nine awards were made across these tracks in September 2000. Brief descriptions of each FY00 project appeared in an October 2000 <em>D-Lib Magazine</em> article [<a href="11zia.html#7">7</a>]; full abstracts are available from the Awards Section at &lt;<a href="http://www.ehr.nsf.gov/ehr/due/programs/nsdl/">http://www.ehr.nsf.gov/ehr/due/programs/nsdl/</a>&gt;.</p>

<p>In FY01 the program received one hundred-nine proposals across its four tracks with the number of proposals in the collections, services, and targeted research tracks increasing to one hundred-one from the eighty received in FY00. In September 2001 grants were awarded to support 35 new projects: 1 project in the core integration track, 18 projects in the collections track, 13 in the services track, and 3 in targeted research. Two NSF directorates, the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) and the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) are both providing significant co-funding on several projects, illustrating the NSDL program's facilitation of the integration of research and education, an important strategic objective of the NSF. Thus far across both fiscal years of the program fifteen projects have enjoyed this joint support.</p>

<p>Following is a list of the FY01 awards indicating the official NSF award number (each beginning with DUE), the project title, the grantee institution, and the name of the Principal Investigator (PI). A condensed description of the project is also included. Full abstracts are available from the Awards Section at the NSDL program site at &lt;<a href="http://www.ehr.nsf.gov/ehr/due/programs/nsdl/">http://www.ehr.nsf.gov/ehr/due/programs/nsdl/</a>&gt;. (Grants with shared titles are formal collaborations and are grouped together.) The projects are displayed by track and are listed by award number. In addition, six of these projects have explicit relevance and application to K-12 education (indicated with a * below). Six others clearly have potential for application to the K-12 arena (indicated with a ** below).</p>

<p>The NSDL program will have another funding cycle in fiscal year 2002 with the next program solicitation expected to be available in January 2002, and an anticipated deadline for proposals in mid-April 2002.</p>

<p>DUE 0121575. <em>Increasing Effective Student Use of the Scientific Journal Literature</em>. Institution: University of Tennessee Knoxville. PI: Carol Tenopir. This project is developing features and sample exemplars of interactive learning modules to help undergraduate users recognize, access, and evaluate high quality scientific and technical information such as those contained in the so-called "grey literature" of technical reports and abstracts generated by various government laboratories.</p>

<p>DUE 0121578**. <em>Textual - Geospatial Integration Services for NSDL</em>. Institution: University of California-Santa Barbara. PI: Jim Frew. Operational services are being constructed that make it easy for users of the NSDL to find and integrate semantically related information in heterogeneously represented items. Of particular interest is integrated access to information occurring in collections of texts and collections of maps and images that is semantically related in terms of the geospatial features and regions. Users can find maps or images containing features or places that are referred to implicitly within texts; or they can find texts that implicitly reference features and places contained in maps and images.</p>

<p>DUE 0121596. <em>Decentralized Image Retrieval for Education (DIRECT)</em>. Institution: University of Virginia Main Campus. PI: Scott Acton. A peer-to-peer content based image retrieval (CBIR) service is being developed to enable a user to designate a query image so that the library may be searched for images of similar content. Image matching is done not by text metadata but by the color, texture, and shape of the image objects. </p>

<p>DUE 0121656. <em>An OAI-Compliant Federated Physics Digital Library for the NSDL</em>. Institution: Old Dominion University Research Foundation. PI: Kurt Maly. This project is designing and building a cross-archive searching service, based on the Open Archives Initiative, that federates heterogeneous collections having metadata that differ in richness, syntax, and semantics. The initial focus is on federating collections related to physics; however, the techniques and algorithms developed under this proposal will be general enough to work for building a federation service for other communities as well.</p> 

<p>DUE 0121692. <em>Digital Library Services for American Indians</em>. Institution: American Indian Higher Education Consortium. PI: Carrie Billy. This award supports a planning conference to engage a group of Tribal Colleges in dialogue and spark project ideas to ensure that the collections and services of the NSDL are both sensitive to the needs of the Native-American population and reflective of that community's contributions to the SMET educational enterprise.</p>

<p>DUE 0121741. <em>Intelligent Collection Services for and about Educators and Students: Logging, Spidering, Analysis and Visualization</em>. Institution: University of Arizona. PI: Hsinchun Chen. The goal of this project is to develop and enhance retrieval, analysis, categorization, and visualization tools to augment the knowledge, skills and abilities that users bring in various degrees to the information search process. In addition, transaction logs from the library are used by teachers to gauge the use of resources and students' paths through the learning experience; such transaction logs can also be valuable to students as a record of their learning experience within a given course or throughout their educational career.</p>

<p>DUE 0126690. <em>Collaborative Project: Enhancing the Interoperability of Collections and Services</em>. Institution: University of Missouri at Columbia. PI: Su-Shing Chen. In this collaborative work a team from the University of California - Berkeley is working primarily on collection interoperability while a team from the University of Missouri - Columbia is focusing its efforts on enhancing the interoperability of services (see DUE 0127580).</p>

<H3>Targeted Research Track</H3> 

<p>DUE 0121527. <em>Design and Evaluation of Maintenance Tools for Distributed Digital Libraries</em>. Institution: Texas Engineering Experiment Station. PI: Frank Shipman. This targeted research project is investigating and developing tools and social protocols to make more feasible the management and maintenance of "author-based" distributed digital library collections, in which material is placed into the library by the author, and librarians (collection managers) organize and annotate it for the library patrons.</p>

<p>DUE 0121635** and 0121743. <em>Collaborative Research: Developing a Learner-Centered Metathesaurus for Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology Education</em>. Institutions: University of Maryland Baltimore County and University of California Berkeley. PIs: Bill Wood and Alice Agogino. This collaborative project is investigating the creation of a learner-centered metathesaurus based on the analysis of transactions between learners and different types of learning resources. Three modes of interaction are being considered. The first involves data in which many students respond to the same problem (the "Problem of the Week" at the Math Forum). The second interactional mode involves data from transactions between learners and experts (the Math Forum's "Ask Dr. Math" feature). The final interactional mode under study uses collections at a third resource, www.smete.org, where learner usage is more in the traditional library mode of search-retrieve. </p>

<p>DUE 0121769. <em>Developing a National Science Digital Library (NSDL) LibQUAL+ Protocol</em>. Institution: Association of Research Libraries. PI: Duane Webster. Under the auspices of the Association of Research Libraries this project is modifying and repurposing the existing LibQUAL+ protocol for assessing the services provided for the user community of the NSDL program.</p>
