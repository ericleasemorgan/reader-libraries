		<h3 class="blue">Abstract</h3> 
<p class="blue"> <em>PhysNet</em> offers online services that enable a physicist to
keep in touch with the worldwide physics community and to receive
all information he or she may need. In addition to being of great value to physicists, these services are 
practical examples of the use of modern methods of digital libraries,
in particular the use of metadata harvesting.</p>
<p class="blue">One service is <em>PhysDoc</em> [<A HREF="12severiens.html#PhysDoc">13</A>].
This  consists of 
a Harvest-based online information broker- and gatherer-network, which harvests information from the local
web-servers of professional physics institutions worldwide
(mostly in Europe and USA so far). <em>PhysDoc</em> focuses on
scientific information posted by the individual scientist at
his local server, such as documents, publications, reports, publication
lists, and lists of links to documents. All rights are reserved for the authors
who are responsible for the content and quality of their documents.</p>
<p class="blue"><em>PhysDis</em> [<A HREF="12severiens.html#PhysDis">14</A>] is an analogous service but specifically for
university theses, with their dual requirements of examination work and
publication.</p>
<p class="blue">
The strategy  is to select high quality
sites containing  metadata.
We  report here  on the present status of <em>PhysNet</em>,
our experience in operating it, and the development of its usage. To
continuously involve authors, research groups, and national
societies is considered crucial for a future stable service.</p>

<H3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Anybody can feel drowned by the flood of irrelevant information when
searching for a small but precious bit of relevant information in the
web using search engines. Everyone dreams of a 'portal' somewhere in the
web providing specific information: certified,
up-to-date, correct, complete, just in time and ready to use. Several
events have now prepared the ground for a future realization of these dreams.
This paper describes our work in support of the field of physics
and its
relevant scientific documents.</p>

<p>This year the American Physical Society (APS), [<A HREF="12severiens.html#aps">5</A>] as one of the
major national physics societies in the world with some well renowned
scientific journals (<em>Physical Review Letters</em>, <em>Physical Review</em> [<A HREF="12severiens.html#aps_publish">37</A>]), has allowed the authors of 
articles accepted for publication in APS journals to put a copy (even a scanned copy of the
original paper journal printout) on the authors' own local institute's
web-server [<A HREF="12severiens.html#aps_copyright">38</A>]. Netiquette commands that the
author set a link to the publisher's server and cite the refereed
document. Why is APS apparently giving away the
'ownership' of its documents? Because, by now, the publisher is proud of
offering a full bunch of sophisticated add-on services, such as
crosslinking, search engines, list of society members, and other
professional services. Hence, the publisher has moved from the
ownership of documents to professional add-on services.</p>

<p>This article describes  <em>PhysDoc</em> [<A HREF="12severiens.html#PhysDoc">13</A>],
 a physics document
portal, which allows documents to be searched across physics
institutions' web-servers worldwide. <em>PhysDoc</em> is part of <em>PhysNet</em>,
the worldwide Physics Departments and Documents Network, under the auspices of the
European Physical Society (EPS) and several national societies and
controlled by the EPS Action Committee on Publication and Scientific
Communication (ACPuC) [<A HREF="12severiens.html#acpuc">2</A>]. The technical development and
standards are coordinated by the Institute of Science Networking [<A 
HREF="12severiens.html#scinst">11</A>] at the Physics Department of Oldenburg University.
<em>PhysDis</em> [<A HREF="12severiens.html#PhysDis">14</A>] is a special subset of
<em>PhysDoc</em>, a service for Ph.D. theses of universities.
Theses need a specific set of metadata because of their dual role as 
examination works at a department and as publications by the authors.</p>

<p><em>PhysDoc</em> is based on the concept of metadata harvesting, introduced by the Harvest project and being developed by the Open Archive Initiative (OAI)
[<A HREF="12severiens.html#oai">7</A>] of 1999. 
The increasing availability of long-term stable archiving formats (XML, MathML,
SGML) and universally readable browser formats (HTML) and the Harvest
technique for distributed gathering and brokerage form the technical foundation
of a fully distributed worldwide information system. 
The Open Archive Initiative has
proposed a seamless superstructure for the management of scientific
documents and called for a worldwide standard for the gateway
between information repositories and search engines.
<em>PhysDoc</em> uses the international
metadata standards defined by the Dublin Core initiative 
[<A HREF="12severiens.html#dc">19</A>] for object description to enable search engines 
to make full use of the information given by the local repositories
documents, if metadata have been added. Then there is no necessity
to write individual wrappers for each local data-source.</p>

<p>The European Physical Society (EPS) [<A HREF="12severiens.html#eps">1</A>] has opened its
<em>PhysNet</em> services [<A HREF="12severiens.html#PhysNet">12</A>] to develop into a
worldwide service network supported by national
learned societies, physics institutions, and university departments.
 
<P>
A cooperation with the International Mathematical Union (IMU) [<A HREF="12severiens.html#imu">3</A>] has been negotiated to align the Physics Network with the respective emerging worldwide Mathematical Network <em>MathNet</em> [<A HREF="12severiens.html#mathnet">17</A>].</p>

<p><em>PhysDis</em> is part of the German project 'Dissertationen Online' [<A HREF="12severiens.html#dissonline">15</A>], a project of the IuK Initiative Information and  Communication of the Learned Societies in Germany [<A HREF="12severiens.html#iuk">8</A>], supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) [<A HREF="12severiens.html#dfg">9</A>].  Within Germany, the German National library [<A HREF="12severiens.html#ddb">10</A>] will serve as an archive, the university libraries as local repositories for the posting on the web, the departments for the exam-relevant part of metadata, and the learned societies for the search engines and training of candidates. The author's rights are reserved for the candidate.</p>

<p>We present the history, the concept, the realization, and our
experiences for the field-specific document portals <em>PhysDoc</em> and
<em>PhysDis</em>. We evaluate the coverage as well as the usage throughout
the first six years of operation.</p>

<p>The report is complemented by documenting the present diplomatic
activities to assure international control and freedom, namely the
unbiased possibility of any professional author of contributing to the
seamless system without a possibility of dominating the decisions. </p>

<p>The authors feel that a professional field-specific document portal in
science should be restricted to documents that have been
refereed or have been put into the web by scientists themselves. Thus,
the scientists of professional institutes and physics departments at
universities worldwide take responsibility for the quality,
integrity, actuality, and completeness of the information they decide
to put into the services via their local posting, in particular for
their copyright. The <em>PhysDoc</em> service, on the other hand, has 
to ensure the visibility
of information on the net through its search engines.</p>


<A NAME="chap_his"><H3>History</H3>

<h4>Organization</h4>

<p>In 1994, a series of meetings, visits, and contacts cleared the visions of
future possibilities of using the web for professional services in physics. The most famous event was a one-day conference at Los Alamos <em>Physics ePrint Archive</em> [<A HREF="12severiens.html#losalamos_conf">24</A>], where the German Physical Society (DPG) [<A HREF="12severiens.html#dpg">6</A>] presented its vision [<A HREF="12severiens.html#hilf_losalamos_1994">26</A>] and offered its international cooperation. In subsequent meetings that year with R. Kelly, technical director of APS, the vision of moving from ownership of information to
professional add-on services for publishers as their future marketing concept became clear.</p>

<p>The EPS committee on publication, under the chairmanship of Franck Lalo&euml;, organized a series of early meetings and sessions, where publishers and physicists outlined their visions [<A HREF="12severiens.html#hilf_paris_1994">28</A>]. At a certain point it was realized that the committee needed a new concept, as well as a new mandate, in order to better fit the general purposes of a learned society such as EPS; one concern was an appropriate balance of the contribution from private publishing houses to the committee, which assumed a new name: 'Action Committee on Scientific Publications and Communication'. One of the activities of this new committee was to set up new professional information services for physicists, such as <em>PhysDep</em> and <em>PhysDoc</em> as well as to coordinate the development of several European mirrors of the Los Alamos preprint server in order to improve safety (in case of fire, etc., destroying the computers) and rapidity of the connections.</p>

<p>The present committee (chaired by C. Montonen) with the Secretary General of the EPS (D.Lee) set up the procedures used to make decisions: proposition to the committee, eventual approval,  annual report, decision whether it (still) meets the standards and requirements of a society's service. The committee also provided a small seed funding for operation. This made <em>PhysNet</em> possible, gave an ideal supportive framework, and boosted the acceptance by national societies as well as users. </p>

<p>For the German Physical Society (DPG) we offered training courses for nominated local experts from the physics departments at German universities, to teach them how to set up web-servers of their own. Thus, virtually all
physics departments in Germany had installed a web-server by the end of 1994. The  list of links to these servers and the email list of their operators formed the nucleus of <em>PhysNet</em> [<A HREF="12severiens.html#PhysNet">12</A>], a collection of services now provided by the EPS together with its international partners.</p>

<p>In the next few years, these lists of links were steadily expanded, adding more physics institutions from more countries. Further physics-related subservices were integrated as well.</p>

 <h4>The development of <em>PhysDoc</em></h4>

<p>In 1995, a Harvest search engine [<A HREF="12severiens.html#harvest">32</A>], an open
software product by the University of Colorado, was successfully
installed by our collaborator H. Stamerjohanns. The software allows 
gatherers to be installed which harvest information from given sources entered from link lists. An index-file is created and forwarded to a broker, which then answers incoming queries. Harvest allows 
networks of distributed gatherers and brokers to be set up.</p>

<p>Harvest is an integrated set of tools to gather, extract, search, 
cache, and replicate relevant information across the Internet. 
Harvest was a research project led by M. Schwartz at the University of 
Colorado. It was developed by members of the Internet Research Task Force Research Group on Resource Discovery (IRTF-RD), consisting of M. Bowman (Transarc Corporation), P. Danzig (University of Southern California), U. Manber (University of Arizona), and M. Schwartz (IRTF-RD chair, 
University of Colorado). Harvest has been used in some scientific document systems in Europe, and is used in Australia to connect governmental authorities at all levels. Unfortunately, Harvest is no longer supported by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and has become part of the free software development process. Presently, support and development (e.g., to make use of RDF) is headed and guaranteed by several groups in the world [<a href="12severiens.html#harvest">32</a>].</p>

<p>In 1997, R. Schw&auml;nzl and J. Pl&uuml;mer of the Technical Advisory Committee of the IMU in conjunction with us created MyMetaMaker (MMM) [<A HREF="12severiens.html#mmm">33</A>], 
a web-form for enriching documents with metadata. In its latest version MMM produces Dublin-Core conformal HTML-metadata.</p>

<p>Also in 1997, we started to set up the <em>PhysDoc</em> service as part of <em>PhysNet</em>. Using the <em>PhysDep</em> database of physics institutions, we browsed across the institutions' web-servers and gathered links with relevant information on science documents such as reports, publication lists, preprints, or even scanned copies of published papers. We started with European servers and later added servers from locations in the US. The list of URLs for publications on local web-servers is still incomplete.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1998, the 'Dissertationen Online' project started within the scope of which we set up <em>PhysDis</em>, a collection of online 
information and full texts of Ph.D. theses at physics institutions in
Europe.</p>

<p>By the time of the international workshops <em>CRISP, Cooperative Research
Information Systems in Physics</em>, [<A HREF="12severiens.html#crisp2">25</A>] in Oldenburg in 1997 and 1999, the way was paved for worldwide distribution, and sharing of work and services on equal footing among the participating persons, groups, and national societies.</p>

<p>In May 2000, a new era towards internationalization was initiated by the action committee [<A HREF="12severiens.html#acpuc">2</A>] of EPS and the Committee on Electronic Information and Communication CEIC [<A HREF="12severiens.html#ceic">4</A>] of IMU (International Mathematical Union) through the negotiation of an official cooperative agreement [<A HREF="12severiens.html#imu_eps">21</A>] between <em>PhysNet</em> and <em>MathNet</em>, and especially its distributed document service MPRESS [<A HREF="12severiens.html#mpress">18</A>].</p>

<p>In parallel, since <em>PhysNet</em> will comply with the Open Archive Initiative
standards and requirements, it will be embedded and integrated into the
up-coming seamless distributed network of all disciplines [<A HREF="12severiens.html#fox">22</A>].</p>


<A NAME="chap_con"><H3>Concept</H3></a>

<p>A document portal for a scientific field such as physics has to comply
with the following requirements [<A HREF="12severiens.html#borghoff">30</A>]:</p>

<UL>

<li> <B>Coverage</b> of all relevant professional physics documents: Therefore our ultimate goal is to gather information from all professional physics
institutions worldwide.</li></ol></UL>

<UL><li> Restriction to professional sources to ensure <B>relevant</B> answers:
Therefore we restrict <em>PhysDoc</em> to documents from authors at physics
institutions inasmuch as they are registered at their national physical
society.</li></ol></UL>

<UL><li> <B>Up-to-date, complete, and authorized</B> documents: Therefore we only gather
information directly from authors of professional institutions. 
</li></ol></UL>

<UL><li> The gathered information to be condensed and filtered for the individual
needs <b>intelligent add-on services</b> such as thesauri, forward
and backward linking, refereeing, annotations, comments, and alerting. We decided
that these are requirements for all scientific fields and that we
have to leave these new and necessary services to future technical
development, to providers, and to cross-disciplinary actions and initiatives.
We see the Open Archive Initiative as the suitable superstructure. This
harmonizes with our general aim to separate the steps of scientific publication
into independent services: First publish on the web directly from the author,
then make use of or apply add-on services for filtering, and finally gather and
search.</li></ol>
</UL>

<p>As a non-commercial service we restricted <em>PhysDoc</em> and
<em>PhysDis</em> to those databases which are free to use, online,
non-proprietary, and leave the rights with the authors.</p>

<p>The service is based on a distributed, heterogenous, large set of document and data sources. It is complemented by an analogously distributed workforce: the local experts responsible for organizing the online archive of documents of local authors, and finally the operators of the distributed brokers and gatherers. Thus, in principle, there is no strong central workforce needed, apart from 
some administration and network-maintenance offered by the EPS.  </p>

<p>Although the whole system may appear difficult to manage, it has been
operating very smoothly for more then 4 years and is considered the only structure stable against scaling of document numbers, site numbers, work
force needed, and net-load.</p>

<A NAME="chap_ser"><H3>Services</H3></a>

<p>The aim of <B><em>PhysDoc</em></B> is to enhance the public accessibility 
of scientific documents stored on local institutions' servers.
The core of <em>PhysDoc</em> is a list of links to document sources of 
physics institutions worldwide. They are ordered by continent,
country, and town. Such document sources are, for example, preprints, research reports, annual reports, and lists of publications of local research groups and individual scientists.</p>

<p>It is especially advisable to store documents or document information (such as publication lists) locally if the authors or their institutions want to control integrity, accessibility and archiving. Local storage allows for easy and frequent updating directly by authors. Thus, <em>PhysDoc</em> complements the central preprint server such as the arXiv.org e-Print archive [<A HREF="12severiens.html#arXiv">16</A>] and the publisher's scientific journals. </p>

<p><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="physdoc.gif" ALT="Layout of PhysDoc">
<BR>
<strong>Figure 1: Homepage of the <em>PhysDoc</em> service</strong>
</CENTER>
</p>

<p>The <em>PhysDoc</em> service is combined with a Harvest-based search
engine. The search can be either a 'simple search' by just giving some
keywords or by combining terms with Boolean operators, or it can be specified in a
query form by author, title, and 'fulltext,' which is useful in case of
documents coming with the respective metadata.</p>

<p>Harvest allows <em>gatherers</em> to be configured by feeding in a list of web-links and their click-successors.  The gatherer extracts the
retrieval-relevant information from the gathered files by using
file-type-specific summarizers. The extracted and summarized  file
descriptions are stored in SOIF-format (Standard Object Interchange
Format) in the gatherer's database. Harvest <em>brokers</em> respond to
queries using local index files. These index files can be composed of the
indexed information from different distributed gatherers and brokers. The
advantage of Harvest is the separation of gatherer and broker components,
which allows for the seamless cooperation of many distributed gatherers as
well as brokers and thus is scalable.</p>

<p>To date, we have collected information from <B>1,113 document lists</B> of local physics institutions and departments: 439 in Germany, 92 in France, 174 in UK, 120 in Italy, 189 in other European countries, and 99 in the USA
and other countries worldwide. The number of the linked publication lists
in <em>PhysDoc</em> seems to be stable with about 1,100 links, but certainly is still incomplete.</p>

<p>The number of documents reached by these links cannot be
measured exactly, since distributed authors may change their
input without notice. Our estimate of the number of reached documents thus far  is
well <B>above 70,000</B> (62,000 in April 1999 and 50,000 in October
1998). To keep the links for <em>PhysDoc</em> up to date is
time consuming, because links are often moved around without notice by the authors at
their local sites.</p>

<p>It is therefore recommended that institutions set up one central web-page at their server providing the links to all the document lists of their subinstitutions, research groups, and individual scientists. Recently, more institutions have been setting up a local sub-homepage leading to all physics documents information pages of their local research groups and scientists. This increases the stability of our service.</p>

<p>Authors should additionally qualify their documents by adding metadata
according to the Dublin Core standard. For this purpose we provide the web-form MyMetaMaker (MMM) [<A HREF="12severiens.html#mmm">33</A>] which enables the authors to create and integrate the machine-readable metadata, without the need to know  the complicated Dublin Core specifications, and thus to improve the
web-visibility of their documents. </p>

<p><B><em>PhysDis</em></B> is a subset of <em>PhysDoc</em> and focuses on Ph.D.
theses and dissertations as a special kind of publication. In the past few 
years, the prestige of these documents in physics has changed from 'grey
literature' to an important source dealing with the latest research
results. An agreement was reached with the German
National library [<A HREF="12severiens.html#ddb">10</A>] concerning the set of metadata
and the archiving of the electronic full texts.</p>

<p><em>PhysDis</em> currently offers 229 links to collections of Ph.D. theses and dissertations in 18 European countries, plus the collections of MIT and  Fermilab in the US. We list 85 links in Germany, 48 in Spain, 21 in Sweden, 20 in Switzerland, and 55 links in other European countries. In total, 1,818 datasets including 250 full texts have been collected so far.</p>

<p>The <em>PhysDis</em> service also uses a Harvest-based broker to
allow for retrieval across all of the listed links.</p>

<P>
An <b>upload interface</b> is offered for both services to allow local
institutions or the institutions' authors to register documents, information on documents,
or lists of theses.</p>

<A NAME="chap_exp"><H3>Experience and Usage</H3></a>

<p>For an innovative new service the only way to analyze the market is to put the service online, monitor its usage in detail, and perform live experiments. Here we give some examples of our experiences in taking actions to publicize the service and using an internal tool to monitor usage of each file.</p>

<p>In response to publicity most usage statistics showed a temporarily larger
response and usage statistics also showed a gradual, less dramatic long-term increase, which was the the desired result.</p>

<strong>Figure 2: File-requests plus usage of the search engines of the <em>PhysDoc</em>

<p>Figure 2 shows, that the <em>PhysDoc</em>-service is mostly used to search for documents. Surfing the list of links is quite low, though the lists are essential to configure the search engine. The gap in year 2000 resulted from technical problems with the machine, which have now been solved.</p>

<p>Some positive examples:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
Email letters to 1,600 website operators worldwide generated the largest short-term increase in usage.</li></ol></ul>
<ul> <li>
Presentations at fairs and exhibitions caused a large (and unexpected)
response. As an example, we show the usage of <em>PhysDis</em>, the Physics

<p>In May 1999, we changed the layout of <em>PhysNet</em> to a frame-free minimal design of the web pages, allowing for easy linking, fast downloading for the customer, and access by any type of browser and operating system. A lot of positive responses were received from users, especially regarding the decision to replace the frames with tables.</p>

<p>Communication with users and system operators is one of the crucial
aspects of operating a public service. We try to respond individually to any email contact, and we also use email to disseminate information about improvements to the service.</p>

<p>For example, any operator can help the users of his server and of <em>PhysNet</em> (and other portal services) by providing a detailed and stable  linking structure. One element of this structure should be a central linking site for all the publication lists on the server, which should have a stable address. In <em>PhysDoc</em> we observed that addresses of publication lists are not stable over longer time periods on most servers, but stable linking is a central requirement for every referencing system.</p>

<p>The largest long-term increase in usage was achieved by increasing the quality of the service:</p>

<UL>
<li> including some US institutes,</li></ol></UL>
<UL><li> maintaining a high level of reliability (ratio of broken links below
4 percent),</li></ol></UL>
<UL><li> increasing the number of research groups covered,</li></ol></UL>
<UL><li> responding quickly and individually to uploaded information, remarks, emails, and 
recommendations,</li></ol></UL>
<UL><li> simultaneous searching to answer queries through <em>PhysDoc</em> as a
distributed database of documents and the arXiv.org e-Print archive as a
central database for documents (through Univ. Augsburg [<A HREF="12severiens.html#metaphys">36</A>]).</li></ol>
</UL>

<p>Some drawbacks: For a month the search engine for documents had an unresolved breakdown; it was operating but returning few results. This resulted in a permanent decrease in usage from which the service has not yet recovered since resuming full operation.</p> 

<A NAME="chap_vis"><H3>Vision of Future Developments</H3></a>

<p>For the future long-term stability and professional usefulness of a  
field-specific document portal, some lines should be followed:</p>

<UL>
<li> A strict realization of the OAI requirements for all distributed document
servers, departments, institutes, and societies, allowing for a stable service for
any search engines.</li></ol></UL>
<UL><li> A strict and standardized usage of metadata for all posted
documents.</li></ol></UL>
<UL><li> A distributed network of independently operating brokers,
invulnerable to any local breakdown of servers.</li></ol>
</UL>

<p>To harvest all relevant information on physics documents worldwide is a huge task, but by distributing the work among national societies and through international coordination, it can be done, and it is worth the long-term
engagement because it should provide the means to make research processes more effective.</p>

<H3>Hints on 'what to do and how to join?'</H3>

<p><B>Authors:</B></p>

<UL>

<li> provide at least one browse-format (ps, pdf, html);</li></ol></UL>

<UL><li> put the original file of each document into a format suitable for archiving<BR> 
<font size="-1">(SGML: use e.g. Word-to-SGML converters; 
  XML: use e.g. LaTeX-to-XML converters;
  HTML: use e.g. LaTeX-to-HTML converters, use LaTeX-package 'html' and add-ons);</font></li></ol></UL>

<UL><li> put into the document your 'author's right declaration' (copyright in
Anglo-Saxon countries); e.g. we use at least: ''we hereby allow any
distribution, downloading, redistribution of this document as long as the
document is kept totally unchanged and complete, and a link is given to
the original, and the document is cited correctly by : &lt;authors, title,
date, URN/URL&gt;''; </li></ol></UL>

<UL><li> add the correct metadata according to the international Dublin Core
standard to allow search engines to find the document: instead of trying
to learn these only machine-readable codes, use ready-to-use web-form MMM
[<A HREF="12severiens.html#mmm">33</A>]; </li></ol></UL>

<UL><li> put the document files on your institution's server and put a link to your
document list; </li></ol></UL>

<UL><li> take care that the institution's operator has a correct link from his
link list collection of authors' document lists to your list; </li></ol></UL>

<UL><li> improve your own homepage by including metadata so that search
engines can directly find your offered professional information 
(publication list, research fields, address, etc.) by using, e.g., the
ready-to-use web-form 'Professional HomePage' [<A HREF="12severiens.html#php">34</A>].
</UL>

<p><B>Institute Web-Server Operators:</B></p>

<UL>
<li>
set up one  central web-page on the Institute's server containing
a  list of links to all documents and publication lists of  all the 
subinstitutes, 
research groups, and individual scientists of your local institution; </li></ol></UL>

<UL><li> inform the <em>PhysDoc</em> operators of your web-page; </li></ol></UL>

<UL><li> check the inclusion of your institution and its page in
<em>PhysDoc</em> (misprints, functioning of the link); </li></ol></UL>

<UL><li> put a link on the homepage of your institute to your local list 
of document links; </li></ol></UL>

<UL><li> inform all prospective authors of your institution on <em>PhysDoc</em>
and its tools (e.g., MMM). </li></ol>

</UL>

<p><B>Head of Institutes:</B></p>

<UL>

<li> nominate a knowledgeable person as the expert responsible for setting up
and maintaining the document link list web-page of your institution;
</li></ol></UL>

<UL><li>consider joining the <em>PhysNet</em> World as an institution. This means
registering the mentioned document link list page and upgrading your
department/institute's homepage to the internationally agreed metadata
using the ready-to-use web-form 'Professional HomePage for institutions'
[<A HREF="12severiens.html#php_inst">35</A>],  and informing your institution's personnel
about <em>PhysNet</em> and its services.  (No financial obligations.) </li></ol>

</UL>

<p>
<B>National Physical Societies:</B></p>

<UL>

<li> join <em>PhysNet</em>; </li></ol></UL>

<UL><li> inform the physics institutions in your country about <em>PhysDoc</em>; </li></ol></UL>

<UL><li> set up and maintain a web-list of professional physics institutions
in your country; </li></ol></UL>

<UL><li> integrate this link list into the <em>PhysNet</em> services; </li></ol></UL>

<UL><li> set up and maintain a national active mirror of the <em>PhysDoc</em>
broker; </li></ol></UL>

<UL><li> participate actively in the joint development of
<em>PhysNet</em> (and its rules) with its service <em>PhysDoc</em> as a representative of 
authors and users of document services. </li></ol>
