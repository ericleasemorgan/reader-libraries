        <p class="blue">This paper focuses on the use of NISO OpenURL and MPEG-21 Digital Item 

          Processing (DIP) to disseminate complex objects and their contained 

          assets, in a repository architecture designed for the Research 

          Library of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. In the architecture, 

          the MPEG-21 Digital Item Declaration Language (DIDL) is used as the 

          XML-based format to represent complex digital objects. Through an ingestion process, 

          these objects are stored in a multitude of autonomous OAI-PMH repositories. 

          An OAI-PMH compliant Repository Index keeps track of the creation and 

          location of all those repositories, whereas an Identifier Resolver keeps 

          track of the location of individual complex objects and contained assets. 

          An MPEG-21 DIP Engine and an OpenURL Resolver facilitate the delivery 

          of various disseminations of the stored objects. While these aspects 

          of the architecture are described in the context of the LANL library, 

          the paper will also briefly touch on their more general applicability.</p>

        <H3><a name="Head1"></a>1. &nbsp; Introduction</H3>

        <p>When compared to most academic and research libraries, the Research 

          Library of the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) follows a rather 

          unique strategy with respect to providing access to digital scholarly 

          information. The general trend in digital library services is to 

          have users access externally hosted materials through third party services, 

          federated through a locally hosted Web Portal. In order to be self-supporting 

          with respect to mission-critical scholarly information, the LANL library 

          acquires or licenses a vast collection of digital scholarly assets, 

          hosts those assets locally, and makes them accessible through locally 

          developed user services. The locally hosted assets include secondary 

          data feeds from ISI, BIOSIS, Inspec, and primary information feeds from 

          major scholarly publishers such as Elsevier, Wiley, IOP, APS, etc.</p>

        <p>At the time of writing, the collection of locally hosted assets amounts 

          to approximately 5 Terabytes of raw materials. In addition to that, 

          the LANL library is actively investigating the deployment of Institutional 

          Repository capabilities to host locally created materials such as technical 

          reports, datasets, videotaped presentations, etc. Also, research is 

          underway to augment the locally hosted collection with materials gathered 

          by focused Web crawling and to include logs detailing the usage of 

          repository assets in the repository as assets in their own right [<a href="02bekaert.html#1">1</a>,<a href="02bekaert.html#2">2</a>]. 

          Hosting, archiving and making accessible such a vast and heterogeneous 

          collection of scholarly assets in a consistent and sustainable manner 

          is a challenge that touches on many areas of Digital Library practice 

          and research, including the identification of assets, the expression 

          of relationships between assets, the representation of assets by means 

          of complex object models, and methods to ingest and access stored assets. 

        </p>

        <p>Over the last year, the Digital Library Research and Prototyping Team 

          of the LANL Research Library has worked on the design of a LANL Repository 

          architecture aimed at ingesting, storing, and making accessible to downstream 

          applications an ever growing heterogeneous digital collection. Also, 

          a working prototype of the design has been implemented. While no claims 

          are being made that the LANL Repository design or implementation are 

          of a nature that merits a comparison with&#151;say&#151;the deliverables of 

          the DSpace [<a href="02bekaert.html#3">3</a>] or Fedora [<a href="02bekaert.html#4">4</a>,<a href="02bekaert.html#5">5</a>] 

          projects, the authors do feel that the architecture has the following 

          interesting properties that should be attractive for repository-related 

          projects beyond the realm of the LANL Research Library:</p>

        <ol>

          <li>The use of the MPEG-21 Digital Item Declaration Language (DIDL) 

            to represent complex objects, as described in our previous D-Lib paper 

            [<a href="02bekaert.html#6">6</a>]. A reading of that paper is recommended to obtain 

            a good understanding of this discussion. </li>

          <li>The natively distributed nature of the architecture. </li>

          <li>The use of a special technique&#151;the XMLtape&#151;to store and make 

            accessible static collections of complex objects.</li> 

          <li>The multi-faceted use of the OAI-PMH to access stored content in 

            incremental batches. </li>

          <li>The use of NISO OpenURL to access stored content or various disseminations 

            thereof. </li>

          <li>The dynamic binding of dissemination methods to stored content.</li> 

          <li>The use of MPEG-21 Digital Item Processing (DIP) to execute different 

            services associated with DIDs upon request of an agent.</li> 

        </ol>

        <p><a href="02bekaert.html#Figure_1">Figure 1</a> introduces the major components of 

          the LANL Repository architecture. As can be seen, the LANL Repository 

          hosts a multitude of autonomous OAI-PMH [<a href="02bekaert.html#7">7</a>] repositories, 

          each of which stores complex digital objects represented using the MPEG-21 

          DIDL [<a href="02bekaert.html#N8">8</a>] format. The Repository Index keeps track of 

          the creation of such autonomous OAI-PMH repositories as well as of their 

          location. The Repository Index is exposed as an OAI-PMH repository in 

          its own right. The OAI-PMH Federator exposes the whole LANL Repository 

          as a single OAI-PMH repository. It interacts with other components of 

          the architecture mainly using the OAI-PMH. The OAI-PMH Federator hides 

          the complexity of the environment to downstream harvesters, and becomes 

          their single point of access to harvest from the LANL Repository. The 

          aforementioned components of the LANL Repository architecture are only 

          briefly discussed in <a href="02bekaert.html#Head3">Section 3</a>. They will be described 

          in detail in a forthcoming paper that focuses on aspects (2), (3) and 

          (4) above. This paper elaborates on properties (2), (5), (6), and (7) 

          of the LANL Repository architecture by describing its use of MPEG-21 

          DIP [<a href="02bekaert.html#9">9</a>] and NISO OpenURL [<a href="02bekaert.html#10">10</a>] for 

          the dynamic dissemination of the stored complex objects and their contained 

          assets. To that end, <a href="02bekaert.html#Head4">Section 4</a> describes the Identifier 

          Resolver, which contains identifiers of stored content, as well as the 

          location of the OAI-PMH repository in which the content resides. The 

          Identifier Resolver is populated through OAI-PMH harvesting and can 

          be queried in a variety of ways, including the Handle protocol [<a href="02bekaert.html#11">11</a>]. 

          The DIP Engine, which works according to MPEG-21 principles, is introduced 

          in the environment to facilitate the delivery of various disseminations 

          of stored content. A high-level insight in the operation of the DIP 

          Engine is provided in <a href="02bekaert.html#Head5">Section 5</a>. <a href="02bekaert.html#Head5">Section 

          5</a> also describes the OpenURL Resolver, which provides a front-end 

          to the LANL Repository from which various disseminations of individual 

          assets contained in the LANL Repository can be obtained using requests 

          compliant with the forthcoming NISO OpenURL Standard.</p>

        <H3><a name="Head2"></a>2. &nbsp; Ingestion into the LANL repository</H3>

        <p>In many cases the delivered assets to be hosted in the LANL Repository 

          are 'complex' in the sense that they consist of multiple individual 

          datastreams that form a single logical unit. For example, a scholarly 

          article may be delivered as a bundle that consists of metadata describing 

          the article, the article itself in PDF and ASCII format, and the references 

          made in the article expressed in XML. The complex nature of the assets 

          led to an investigation regarding existing approaches to represent complex 

          digital objects using XML wrappers, which resulted in the selection 

          of the MPEG-21 Digital Item Declaration Language (DIDL) [<a href="02bekaert.html#8">8</a>] 

          as the sole way to store digital assets in the LANL Repository. DIDL 

          introduces a set of abstract concepts that, together, form a well-defined 

          data model for complex digital objects [note <a href="02bekaert.html#N1">1</a>]. Based 

          on those abstract concepts, DIDL defines a W3C XML Schema that provides 

          broad flexibility and extensibility for the actual representation of 

          compliant complex digital objects [note <a href="02bekaert.html#N2">2</a>]. The DIDL 

          data model recognizes the following entities, each of which has a corresponding 

          XML element in the DIDL XML Schema:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>A <b><i>Container</i></b> is a grouping of <b><i>Containers</i></b> 

            and/or <b><i>Items</i></b>. </li>

          <li>An <b><i>Item</i></b> is a grouping of <b><i>Items</i></b> and/or 

            <b><i>Components</i></b>.</li> 

          <li>A <b><i>Component</i></b> is a grouping of <b><i>Resources</i></b>. 

            Multiple <b><i>Resources</i></b> in the same <b><i>Component</i></b> 

            are considered equivalent and consequently an agent may use any one 

            of them.</li> 

          <li>A <b><i>Resource</i></b> is an individual datastream. </li>

          <li>Secondary information pertaining to a <b><i>Container</i></b>, an 

            <b><i>Item</i></b>, or a <b><i>Component</i></b> can be conveyed by 

            means of a <b><i>Descriptor</i></b>. </li>

        </ul>

        <p>Digital assets to be hosted by the LANL Repository can, in principle, 

          be obtained in a variety of ways including FTP, OAI-PMH harvesting, 

          Web crawling and delivery on physical media. A prototype ingestion process 

          has been developed that turns each obtained asset into an autonomous 

          XML document that wraps the datastream(s) of which the asset consists. 

          Such an XML document is named a Digital Item Declaration (DID); all 

          LANL DIDs are compliant with the MPEG-21 DIDL specification. As such, 

          for example, the different datastreams of the previously mentioned scholarly 

          article will be contained in a single DID, which will physically contain 

          and/or reference the various datastreams that make up the complex object. 

          The DID also contains information added by the ingestion process, for 

          example, aimed at expressing relationships between contained datastreams, 

          the media type of datastreams, etc. The actual use of DIDL in the LANL 

          Repository, and the LANL DIDL profile is described in detail in [<a href="02bekaert.html#6">6</a>] 

          [note <a href="02bekaert.html#N3">3</a>]. <a href="02bekaert.html#Appendix_A">Appendix A</a> shows 

          an actual DID.</p>

        <p>For the purpose of this paper, the use of identifiers in LANL DIDs 

          is important. Two types of identifiers are distinguished. The manner 

          in which they are conveyed in DIDs has been revised to some extent when 

          compared to our previous D-Lib paper [<a href="02bekaert.html#6">6</a>]:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>DID-identifiers: A DID-identifier is a globally unique identifier 

            assigned by the repository ingestion process to each DID. The DID-identifier 

            is conveyed in a <b><i>Container</i></b>-level <b><i>Descriptor</i></b> 

            that uses the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>dii:identifier</font> 

            element from the MPEG-21 DII XML Namespace [<a href="02bekaert.html#12">12</a>]. 

            During the ingestion process, DID <b><i>Items</i></b> and DID <b><i>Components</i></b> 

            receive XML IDs [<a href="02bekaert.html#13">13</a>] that are attached as attributes 

            to the corresponding <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>didl:Item</font> 

            and <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>didl:Component</font> 

            XML elements from the MPEG-21 DIDL XML Namespace. As a result, they 

            are addressable using a combination of the DID-identifier of the DID 

            in which they are contained, and their own XML ID. DID-identifiers 

            are crucial for the functioning of the LANL Repository itself and 

            for its directly associated processes, such as the MPEG-21 DIP Engine 

            that is discussed later. The DID-identifier and the associated XML 

            IDs of a sample DID are shown in <a href="02bekaert.html#Appendix_A">Appendix A</a>. </li>

          <li>Content-identifiers: Content-identifiers are directly related to 

            identifiers that are natively attached to a&#151;set of&#151;datastream(s) 

            before their ingestion into the LANL Repository. They are typically 

            inferred from the ingested assets. Indeed, in many cases those assets 

            have identifiers that were associated with them when they were created 

            or published. For example, Content-identifiers could be accession 

            numbers for records in A&amp;I databases, DOIs [note <a href="02bekaert.html#N4">4</a>] 

            for journal articles etc. According to the LANL DIDL profile [<a href="02bekaert.html#6">6</a>], 

            Content-identifiers are attached to the <b><i>Item</i></b> level of 

            DIDs only. They are considered special metadata about the <b><i>Item</i></b> 

            and are conveyed using the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>dc:identifier</font> 

            element from the DC XML Namespace [note <a href="02bekaert.html#N5">5</a>] in an 

            <b><i>Item</i></b>-level <b><i>Descriptor</i></b>. This is illustrated 

            by the sample DID shown in <a href="02bekaert.html#Appendix_A">Appendix A</a>. </li>

        </ul>

        <H3><a name="Head3"></a>3. &nbsp; The multi-faceted use of the OAI-PMH 

          in the LANL Repository</H3>

        <p>Once a delivered asset has been turned into a DID by the ingestion 

          process, the DID is stored in an OAI-PMH repository. Data assets at 

          LANL are typically received in large batches, since secondary or primary 

          publishers that account for the bulk of the data to be stored in the 

          LANL Repository deliver weekly or annual feeds. In those cases, an autonomous 

          OAI-PMH repository is created per delivered batch. The OAI-PMH <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>identifier</font> 

          used by these repositories is the DID-identifier, and the OAI-PMH <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>datestamp</font> 

          is the datetime of creation or update of a DID. As those repositories 

          only contain DIDs, the only supported <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>metadataPrefix</font> 

          is DIDL. As a result, many autonomous OAI-PMH repositories exist in 

          the LANL Repository. A special component, the Repository Index, keeps 

          track of the creation and location of these autonomous OAI-PMH repositories. 

          The Repository Index is itself an OAI-PMH repository. Through interaction 

          with the Repository Index and the autonomous OAI-PMH repositories, harvesters 

          working on behalf of downstream applications can selectively gather 

          DIDs from the LANL Repository that were added or updated since the previous 

          harvest, and&#151;in good OAI-PMH Service Provider tradition&#151;do something 

          meaningful with them.</p>

        <p>In order to relieve downstream harvesters from the burden of having 

          to interact with all autonomous OAI-PMH repositories, and having to 

          understand other details of the LANL Repository architecture, the OAI-PMH 

          Federator is introduced. The OAI-PMH Federator exposes the whole LANL 

          Repository as a single OAI-PMH repository. The OAI-PMH Federator becomes 

          the single point of access to the LANL Repository for harvesters&#151;each 

          of which is internal to LANL&#151;hiding the complexity of the LANL Repository 

          environment from them. As a result, the applications on whose behalves 

          the harvesters operate can permanently remain in sync with the LANL 

          Repository situation using a uniform technique&#151;OAI-PMH harvesting. 

          The multi-faceted use of the OAI-PMH in the LANL Repository, as briefly 

          summarized in this Section, will be explained in detail in a forthcoming 

          paper.</p>

        <H3><a name="Head4"></a>4. &nbsp; A special Service Provider: the Identifier 

          Resolver</H3>

        <p>Harvesters work on behalf of Service Providers, collect DIDs from the 

          LANL Repository, and build services with the collected information. 

          As a result, identifiers contained in the harvested DIDs become available 

          in applications such as search engines. As mentioned before, these identifiers 

          can either be DID-identifiers identifying DIDs or DID entities, or Content-identifiers 

          identifying content contained in DIDs. Obviously it is essential that, 

          when such identifiers show up in downstream applications, the corresponding 

          content can be retrieved from the LANL Repository. For this purpose 

          the Identifier Resolver is introduced to the environment. The Identifier 

          Resolver is a special-purpose Service Provider that collects the information 

          it requires from the LANL Repository through recurrent OAI-PMH harvesting. 

          From the harvested information, it only uses the DID-identifiers, the 

          Content-identifiers, and the baseURL of the OAI-PMH repository in which 

          these occur. </p>

        <p>The Identifier Resolver consists of two modules, reflecting the nature 

          of the contained identifiers:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>A DID-identifier module, shown in <a href="02bekaert.html#Table_1">Table 1</a>, 

            which only contains DID-identifiers and the baseURL of the autonomous 

            OAI-PMH repository in which the identified DID is contained. </li>

          <li>A Content-identifier module, shown in <a href="02bekaert.html#Table_2">Table 2</a>, 

            which maps Content-identifiers to DID-identifiers. </li>

        </ul>

        <p>Tables[<a href="02bekaert.html#Table_1"> 1</a>] and [<a href="02bekaert.html#Table_2">2</a>] illustrate 

          the content of the Identifier Resolver. As can be seen, all identifiers 

          are expressed using the proposed 'info' URI scheme [<a href="02bekaert.html#14">14</a>] 

          [note <a href="02bekaert.html#N6">6</a>]. In <a href="02bekaert.html#Table_1">Table 1</a>, 'info:lanl-repo/i/58f202ac' 

          and 'info:lanl-repo/i/002035b2' are DID-identifiers, of DIDs located 

          in the OAI-PMH repository with <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>baseURL</font> 

          "BaseURL(3)" and "BaseURL(6)", respectively. As these are DID-identifiers, 

          the value of the OAI-PMH <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>identifiers</font> 

          of the DIDs in these repositories is equal to the value of the DID-identifiers. 

          In <a href="02bekaert.html#Table_2">Table 2</a>, Content-identifiers 'info:lanl-repo/apsmeta/123456', 

          'info:lanl-repo/aps/1202252' and 'info:lanl-repo/biosis/abcdef' identify 

          content contained in the DIDs with DID-identifier 'info:lanl-repo/i/58f202ac' 

          and 'info:lanl-repo/i/002035b2', respectively. Within these DIDs, the 

          <b><i>Items</i></b> with which these Content-identifiers are associated 

          have XML IDs '445998', '899952', and '444940', respectively. <a href="02bekaert.html#Appendix_A">Appendix 

          A</a> shows the DID with DID-identifier 'info:lanl-repo/i/58f202ac'.</p>

        </table>

        <p>The Identifier Resolver is accessible to applications in a number of 

          ways, including the Handle protocol, a SOAP-based [<a href="02bekaert.html#15">15</a>] 

          access mechanism, and a C library. Through consultation of the Identifier 

          Resolver, an application can use the OAI-PMH to retrieve the DID with 

          a specified DID-identifier, or the DID in which content with a specified 

          Content-identifier resides. This works as follows:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>If the object with identifier 'info:lanl-repo/i/58f202ac' is requested, 

            a look-up in the Identifier Resolver will learn that it is located 

            at BaseURL(3), in a DID with DID-identifier 'info:lanl-repo/i/58f202ac'. 

            This DID can be obtained by issuing the OAI-PMH request <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>[BaseURL(3)?verb=GetRecord&identifier=info:lanl-repo/i/58f202ac&metadataPrefix=DIDL]</font> </li>

          <li>If the object with identifier 'info:lanl-repo/i/58f202ac#445998' 

            is requested, a look-up of 'info:lanl-repo/i/58f202ac' in the Identifier 

            Resolver will learn that it is located at BaseURL(3), in a DID with 

            DID-identifier 'info:lanl-repo/i/58f202ac'. That DID can be obtained 

            by issuing the OAI-PMH request <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>[BaseURL(3)?verb=GetRecord&identifier=info:lanl-repo/i/58f202ac&metadataPrefix=DIDL],</font> 

            and from the resulting DID, the <b><i>Item</i></b> with XML ID '445998' 

            can be extracted. </li>

          <li>If the object with identifier 'info:lanl-repo/biosis/abcdef' is 

            requested, a look-up in the Identifier Resolver will learn that it 

            is located at BaseURL(6), in a DID with DID-identifier 'info:lanl-repo/i/002035b2', 

            and that&#151;in this DID&#151;it has the XML ID '444940'. From this information, 

            the application can conclude that the requested object is an asset 

            contained in a DID. This DID can be obtained by issuing the OAI-PMH 

            request <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>[BaseURL(6)?verb=GetRecord&identifier=info:lanl-repo/i/002035b2&metadataPrefix=DIDL]</font>, and from the resulting DID, the <b><i>Item</i></b> with XML ID '444940' 

            can be extracted. </li>

        </ul>

        <p>Because Content-identifiers can always be mapped to DID-identifiers 

          through the Identifier Resolver, only DID-identifiers will be used for 

          the discussions in the remainder of this paper.</p>

        <p>In addition to the information shown in <a href="02bekaert.html#Table_2">Table 2</a>, 

          the Identifier Resolver also keeps track of the location of assets for 

          which information providers delivered updated versions. For DIDs, only 

          a single version will ever correspond with a given DID-identifier. However, 

          when an update for content contained in a DID is delivered, typically 

          a new DID is created and stored in another OAI-PMH repository as was 

          the original DID. As a result, the location information for that content 

          changes, and this is reflected in the Identifier Resolver by updating 

          the content of the location information for the Content-identifier involved 

          and saving previously existing information in a history section.</p>

        <H3><a name="Head5"></a>5. &nbsp; Disseminating assets from the LANL Repository</H3>

        <p>As was described, downstream applications obtain DIDs from the LANL 

          Repository through OAI-PMH harvesting. These applications will reference 

          DIDs, DID entities, or more commonly, assets contained in DIDs to allow 

          agents that use the applications to retrieve the referenced entities 

          from the LANL Repository. In order to facilitate the retrieval of various 

         &#151;dynamically generated&#151;disseminations of stored assets, a solution 

          has been designed that is based on the MPEG-21 DIP specification, and 

          on the NISO OpenURL. Various aspects of the solution, of which an initial 

          implementation has been developed, are described in this section.</p>

        <H4><a name="Head5.1"></a>5.1 &nbsp; Associating Services with DID Entities: 

          MPEG-21 Digital Item Methods</H4>

        <p>MPEG-21 Digital Item Processing (DIP) specifies an architecture pertaining 

          to the dissemination of DIDs. This MPEG-21 Part, that remains to be 

          standardized, introduces the concept of a Digital Item Method (DIM), 

          as a means to associate services with a DID and/or its entities. It 

          is worthwhile mentioning that the MPEG-21 DIM concept is closely related 

          to Fedora's "behavior" concept [<a href="02bekaert.html#4">4</a>,<a href="02bekaert.html#5">5</a>]. 

          A DIM is physically contained in the same DID as the entity of the DIDL 

          data model with which it is associated. In the current, pre-standard, 

          practice a DIM is typically accommodated in a <b><i>Component</i></b> 

          entity of the DID, which must contain at least 2 other DID entities:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>A <b><i>Resource</i></b> that contains or references the actual 

            method. In MPEG-21 DIP, the DIM code is expressed using a language 

            that is closely related to the ECMAScript Language [<a href="02bekaert.html#16">16</a>]. 

            As will be explained in the section on the DIP Engine, this ECMA Script 

            does not contain all the actual code required to implement the service. 

            Rather, the ECMA Script is used to bootstrap and coordinate the implementation 

            of the service. It contains calls to code that does the real work.</li> 

          <li>A <b><i>Descriptor</i></b> that contains a sequence of <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>dip:Argument</font> 

            elements from the DIP XML Namespace, one per argument of the DIM. 

            The value of a <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>dip:Argument</font> 

            element always identifies a DID entity. </li>

        </ul>

        <p>A DIM is associated with an entity of a DID using the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>dip:objectType</font>/<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>dip:Argument</font> 

          technique, explained in detail in [<a href="02bekaert.html#6">6</a>]:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>Using a special-purpose <b><i>Descriptor</i></b>, a DID entity can 

            be accorded a <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>dip:ObjectType</font> 

            element from the DIP XML Namespace. </li>

          <li>Using another special-purpose <b><i>Descriptor</i></b>, a DIM can 

            be accorded a <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>dip:Argument</font> 

            element, also from the DIP XML Namespace. </li>

          <li>When, in a DID, the value of a <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>dip:ObjectType</font> 

            element of a DID entity, and the value of the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>dip:Argument</font> 

            of a DIM are equal, then the DIM can be applied to the DID entity </li>

        </ul>

        <p>This is illustrated in the DID shown in <a href="02bekaert.html#Appendix_A">Appendix 

          A</a>, in which a service is associated with a <b><i>Component</i></b> 

          through the value 'urn:uuid:8f64eabf-1dd2-11b2-a3f1-0800209a5b6b'. That 

          value is used as the content of both the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>dip:ObjectType</font> 

          element of the <b><i>Component</i></b>, and the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>dip:Argument</font> 

          element of the DIM. The DIP specification allows entities to have more 

          than one <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>dip:ObjectType</font>. 

          Also, a DIM can bind to more than one entity by using multiple <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>dip:Argument</font> 

          elements, each of which connects via the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>dip:ObjectType</font> 

          to the entities. It is worthwhile mentioning that changes have been 

          made to the DIP specification since the publication of our previous 

          D-Lib paper [<a href="02bekaert.html#6">6</a>]. Processing methods in DIDs are now 

          recognizable by their use of the reserved <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>dip:Arguments</font> 

          element. The notion of a special <b><i>Item</i></b>&#151;the <b><i>Processing 

          Item</i></b>&#151;reserved to contain processing methods is no longer supported.</p>

        <H4><a name="Head5.2"></a>5.2 &nbsp; Dynamically Associating Services 

          with DID entities in the LANL Repository: the Placeholders and the DIP 

          Table</H4>

        <p>As explained in [<a href="02bekaert.html#6">6</a>], the authors felt a general level 

          of discomfort with statically embedding DIMs in DIDs stored in the LANL 

          Repository. Therefore, it was decided to embed Placeholders for DIMs 

          instead of actual DIMs in stored DIDs. When the dissemination of a stored 

          DID is requested, the DIM Inserter module dynamically adds DIMs to that 

          DID in a process that is based on the values of the Placeholders contained 

          in the DID. The result is a Completed DID, which contains assets and 

          associated methods.</p>

        <p>Placeholders can be attached at the <b><i>Container</i></b>, <b><i>Item</i></b> 

          and <b><i>Component</i></b> level of a DID. At the <b><i>Container</i></b> 

          level, the Placeholder conveys to which 'family' the DID belongs. For 

          example, the Placeholder value 'container:ai' shown in <a href="02bekaert.html#Table_3">Table 

          3</a> is used to convey that a DID only contains metadata. This 'family' 

          information is closely related to the ingestion process. At the <b><i>Component</i></b> 

          level, the Placeholder specifies the digital format of the contained 

          datastream. Awaiting the emergence of global unique identifiers for 

          digital formats, values are currently used as shown in the second entry 

          of <a href="02bekaert.html#Table_3">Table 3</a>. These values convey the media type 

          of a datastream as well as a broad classification of the nature of its 

          format. The latter is based on an ontology under development by the 

          Digital Format Registry project [<a href="02bekaert.html#17">17</a>]. The exact nature 

          of <b><i>Item</i></b>-level Placeholders is a matter of ongoing research. 

          Placeholder values are conveyed in DIDs via a <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>diph:PlaceHolder</font> 

          element from a self-defined XML Namespace.</p>

        <p>The actual insertion of DIMs in a DID is achieved through a look-up 

          in a special-purpose registry&#151;the DIP Table. The DIP Table lists all 

          services that can be associated with DID entities from the LANL Repository. 

          In the DIP Table, each service has a Service Identifier. Also, for each 

          service, the DIP Table contains a Placeholder value&#151;as used in the 

          DIDs&#151;with which the service is associated. For example, the first 

          entry of [<a href="02bekaert.html#Table_3">Table 3</a>] shows that the service with 

          Service Identifier 'info:lanl-repo/service/table_of_contents' is associated 

          with all DID entities that have 'container:ai' or 'container:aps' as 

          a Placeholder value. For each service, the DIP Table also lists a pointer 

          to the DIM code that actually implements it.</p>

        <p>The dynamic insertion of DIMs in a DID, as performed by the DIM Inserter 

          module of the LANL Repository, is explained by means of the following 

          example. It is also illustrated in the left part of [<a href="02bekaert.html#Figure_2">Figure 

          2</a>]. Consider a DID, which has a <b><i>Component</i></b>-level Placeholder 

          with a value of 'component:content-stream:text:structured-text:mark-up-language:xml#application/marc+xml'. 

          A look-up of this Placeholder value in the DIP Table reveals that a 

          service with Service Identifier 'info:lanl-repo/service/marc_2_mods', 

          and a pointer to DIM code 'gov.lanl.library.dip.marctomods' are associated 

          with it. This service must be added to the DID. This requires:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>Dereferencing the pointer to the DIM code, and inserting the actual 

            code as a <b><i>Component</i></b> in the DID. Hereby, the Service 

            Identifier 'info:lanl-repo/service/marc_2_mods' is also inserted as 

            the identifier of the <b><i>Component</i></b>.  </li>

          <li>Associating the inserted DIM with the <b><i>Component</i></b> which 

            had 'component:content-stream:text:structured-text:mark-up-language:xml#application/marc+xml' 

            as the Placeholder value. This is achieved by inserting a <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>dip:objectType</font> 

            element, and associating it with the DIM using the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>dip:ObjectType</font>/<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>dip:Argument</font> 

            technique of MPEG-21 DIP described above. </li>

        </ul>

        <p>In order to embed all relevant DIMs into a DID upon dissemination, 

          the process as explained above is repeated for every Placeholder entry 

          found in the DID. The DID of <a href="02bekaert.html#Appendix_A">Appendix A</a> actually 

          illustrates the result of the above actions applied for Placeholder 

          values 'container:aps' and 'component:content-stream:text:structured-text:mark-up-language:xml#application/marc+xml'.</p>

        <H4><a name="Head5.3"></a>5.3 &nbsp; Using an MPEG-21 DIP Engine to process 

          service requests for DIDs</H4>

        <p>MPEG-21 DIP introduces a component, named a DIP Engine, that is capable 

          of processing DIDs upon request of an agent. A DIP Engine is able to 

          respond to service requests in which the following information is conveyed:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>An actual DID. </li>

          <li>An identification of the entity of the DID for which the service 

            is requested.</li> 

          <li>An identification of the method&#151;DIM&#151;contained in the DID that 

            implements the service. </li>

        </ul>

        <p>The actual functioning of the LANL DIP Engine is illustrated in <a href="02bekaert.html#Figure_2">Figure 

          2</a>. Upon receipt of a service request, the DIP Engine will extract 

          the identified DID entity, and DIM. As was mentioned, DIMs are expressed 

          using a language that normatively includes ECMAScript. This ECMAScript 

          does not actually contain all the code required for the implementation 

          of the service request. Rather, the ECMAScript is used by the DIP Engine 

          to bootstrap the process of implementing the service request and to 

          actually coordinate it. To that end, the ECMAScript contains calls to 

          so-called Digital Item Operations. Two types of Digital Item Operations 

          are distinguished in MPEG-21 DIP:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>Digital Item Base Operations&#151;DIBOs: DIBOs are Digital Item Operations 

            that must be supported by every compliant DIP Engine. Currently defined 

            DIBOs include operations to manipulate DIDs at the XML level&#151;e.g. 

            <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>GetDIDLNode</font> 

           &#151;and operations that have general application across a wide range 

            of domains, applications and media types&#151;e.g. <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>PlayResource</font>. </li>

          <li>Digital Item extension Operations&#151;DIxOs: DIxOs are Digital Item 

            Operations that are not defined by MPEG-21 DIP, but are rather defined 

            at the level of specific communities, and applications. DIxOs are 

            the extensibility mechanism built into the DIP Engine. </li>

        </ul>

        <p>An MPEG-21 DIP Engine is typically thought of as a client-side software 

          component that operates on a user terminal. At LANL, a server-side prototype 

          implementation of a DIP Engine has been developed. It currently supports 

          only a few of the DIBOs defined by MPEG-21. But various DIxOs have been 

          coded that implement services that are relevant for and specific to 

          the nature of the collection stored in the LANL Repository. As a matter 

          of fact, all services listed in <a href="02bekaert.html#Table_3">Table 3</a> are implemented 

          using DIxOs. Also, Java-based templates have been developed to facilitate 

          the straightforward creation of more DIxOs. For example, one template 

          can be used as the basis for all DIxOs that use XSL transforms, another 

          for DIxOs that need to call external applications, and yet another for 

          the interaction with Web Services.</p>

        <H4><a name="Head5.4"></a>5.4 &nbsp; Using NISO OpenURL to convey service 

          requests</H4>

        <p>Through OAI-PMH harvesting, downstream applications obtain DIDs and 

          use contained assets in their services. For example, a search engine 

          might extract all textual information from harvested DIDs and make it 

          available for searching by end-users. In this case, brief search results 

          will point back to the corresponding asset stored in the LANL Repository. 

          Obviously, in such pointers the DID-identifiers, their associated XML 

          IDs, and the Content-identifiers will play a crucial role. Also, as 

          was shown, the proposed solution allows for the definition of several 

          services aimed at delivering various disseminations of content. Hence, 

          requests to retrieve content should also be able to convey which actual 

          dissemination of the identified content is requested. This, as a matter 

          of fact, is equivalent to conveying the Service Identifier, as shown 

          in <a href="02bekaert.html#Table_3">Table 3</a>, of the service that implements the 

          required dissemination. Since many downstream applications are Web-based, 

          the discussion will assume that requesting disseminations 

          from the LANL Repository is an HTTP-based process.</p>

        <p>It turns out that the forthcoming NISO OpenURL Standard [<a href="02bekaert.html#10">10</a>] 

          provides a perfect framework to convey such dissemination requests. 

          The initial OpenURL specification [<a href="02bekaert.html#18">18</a>] was specifically 

          introduced for the purpose of reference linking, and was targeted at 

          facilitating the provision of context-sensitive reference links for 

          popular types of scholarly works such as journal articles and books 

          [<a href="02bekaert.html#19">19</a>]. Hereby, identifiers and metadata describing 

          the work are conveyed using a controlled-vocabulary HTTP GET request 

          to a user-specific linking server, which uses its knowledge base and 

          the incoming information to provide a user with appropriate services 

          pertaining to the work. A generalization of the essential components 

          of the initial OpenURL solution [<a href="02bekaert.html#20">20</a>] inspired the 

          nature of the forthcoming NISO OpenURL Standard, which provides a generic 

          framework for the delivery of context-sensitive services pertaining 

          to whichever type of resource referenced in a networked environment. 

          To that end, the OpenURL Standard introduces the notion of a ContextObject, 

          which is an information construct that contains descriptions of various 

          entities involved in the process of providing context-sensitive services. 

          The entities are shown in <a href="02bekaert.html#Table_4">Table 4</a>.</p>

        </table>

        <p>Each entity of the ContextObject can be described by means of identifiers, 

          by means of metadata, and/or by means of private data. A ContextObject 

          can be represented in many ways, and currently, a Key/Encoded-Value 

          (KEV) representation and an XML representation have been defined. A 

          representation of a ContextObject can be transported to a networked 

          system named a Resolver, in order to request services pertaining to 

          the Referent described in it. To decide upon the nature of such services, 

          the Resolver may take entities other than the Referent into account. 

          The network transport can occur using various network protocols, and 

          currently transport over HTTP and HTTPS have been defined.</p>

        <p>From the above, two mappings follow easily:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>The asset from the LANL Repository for which a dissemination is 

            requested ~ the Referent of the OpenURL ContextObject. </li>

          <li>The type dissemination that is requested for the asset ~ the ServiceType 

            of the OpenURL ContextObject. </li>

        </ul>

        <p>An OpenURL Resolver is introduced in the LANL Repository to which all 

          dissemination requests originating from downstream applications will 

          be targeted. Using examples provided earlier in this paper (Tables 1-3), 

          the HTTP transport of the OpenURL Standard, and its KEV representation 

          of the ContextObject, the following are valid OpenURLs to convey dissemination 

          requests to this OpenURL Resolver:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>Display a Table of Contents for the DID with DID-identifier 'info:lanl-repo/i/58f202ac':<br>

            <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>&nbsp; &nbsp; BaseURL(OpenURL 

            Resolver)?<br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;<br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rft_id=info:lanl-repo/i/58f202ac&amp;<br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; svc_id=info:lanl-repo/service/table_of_contents</font> </li>

          <li>Display the MARCXML [note <a href="02bekaert.html#N7">7</a>] record with DID-identifier 

            'info:lanl-repo/i/58f202ac#445998C1' as MODS [note <a href="02bekaert.html#N8">8</a>]:<br>

            <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>&nbsp; &nbsp; BaseURL(OpenURL 

            Resolver)?<br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;<br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rft_id=info:lanl-repo/i/58f202ac#445998C1&amp;<br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; svc_id=info:lanl-repo/service/marc_2_mods</font> </li>

        </ul>

        <p>Content-identifiers can also be used in OpenURL requests. However, 

          as Content-identifiers can always be mapped to a corresponding DID-identifier 

          (see <a href="02bekaert.html#Head4">Section 4</a>), only DID-identifiers are considered 

          here. Currently, the Referent and ServiceType are the only entities 

          of the ContextObject that are used in OpenURL requests. But, NISO OpenURL 

          allows expressing other entities that can be taken into account when 

          responding to dissemination requests. Conveying Requester information 

          may be of particular interest, as this would allow adapting the actual 

          dissemination to the agent requesting it. Requester information could 

          convey identity, and this would allow responding differently to the 

          same service request for the same asset depending on whether the requesting 

          agent is human or machine. Or different humans could receive different 

          disseminations based on recorded preferences. But the NISO OpenURL specification 

          is purposely very generic and extensible, and would also support  

          conveying the characteristics of a user's terminal, and/or the user's location 

          via the Requester entity. Such information could be passed on to the 

          DIP Engine and could be taken into account in the delivery of an actual dissemination. 

          As a matter of fact, the expressiveness of NISO OpenURL seems to resonate 

          nicely with the nature of the MPEG-21 Digital Item Adaptation (DIA) 

          [<a href="02bekaert.html#21">21</a>] effort that focuses on transforming assets for 

          delivery by taking into account characteristics of the requesting terminal, 

          network conditions and other contextual information.</p>

        <H4><a name="Head5.5"></a>5.5 &nbsp; Putting MPEG-21 DID, MPEG-21 DIP, 

          NISO OpenURL, and the OAI-PMH together</H4>

        <p>This section provides a walkthrough of the processes involved in responding 

          to the two OpenURL requests shown above.</p>

        <p>The Table of Contents request involves the following steps: </p>

        <ol>

          <li>Through interaction with the Identifier Resolver, the OpenURL Resolver 

            learns that the Referent with identifier 'info:lanl-repo/i/58f202ac' 

            is a DID located in the OAI-PMH repository with <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size=2>baseURL</font> "BaseURL(3)" 

            (see <a href="02bekaert.html#Table_1">Table 1</a>). </li>

          <li>The OpenURL Resolver retrieves this DID from its OAI-PMH repository byissuing an OAI-PMH <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"size=2>GetRecord</font> request <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"size=2>[BaseURL(3)?verb=GetRecord&identifier=info:lanl-repo/i/58f202ac&metadataPrefix=DIDL]</font>. </li>

          <li>The OpenURL Resolver passes the retrieved DID on to the DIM Inserter, 

            which dynamically adds DIMs to the DID based on contained Placeholder 

            values and look-ups in the DIP Table. </li>

          <li>The DIM Inserter returns the completed DID (see <a href="02bekaert.html#Appendix_A">Appendix 

            A</a>) to the OpenURL Resolver. </li>

          <li>The OpenURL Resolver passes the completed DID, the identifier of 

            the Referent, and the identifier of the ServiceType to the DIP Engine. 

            As a matter of fact, these identifiers are passed on to the DIP Engine 

            as XPath expressions that result from locating the respective identifiers 

            in the DID. However, to avoid complexity this example continues using 

            the actual identifiers. </li>

          <li>Through inspection of the DID, the DIP Engine determines whether 

            the requested service with identifier 'info:lanl-repo/service/table_of_contents' 

            can be applied to the DID entity with identifier 'info:lanl-repo/i/58f202ac'. 

            This is achieved by checking the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"size=2>dip:ObjectType/dip:Argument</font> correspondency.</li> 

          <li>Assuming that the service can indeed be applied, the appropriate 

            DIM is extracted from the DID and is executed by the DIP Engine. This 

            DIM calls a DIxO that actually transforms the XML DID to the XHTML 

            Table of Contents. </li>

          <li>The DIP Engine returns the XHTML Table of Contents to the OpenURL 

            Resolver. </li>

        </ol>

        <p>With regard to the MARCXML to MODS request, the process involved in responding to 

          this OpenURL request is similar to the one described above, with these 

          nuances:</p>

        <ol>

        <H3><a name="Head6"></a>6. &nbsp; Conclusion</H3>

        <p>This paper has described aspects of the LANL Repository architecture 

          pertaining to the dissemination of complex objects or their contained 

          assets. In this architecture, NISO OpenURL is used to encode dissemination 

          requests. This takes the actual use of OpenURL to a new level. Indeed, 

          OpenURL has so far only been used to deliver services that were calculated 

          based on metadata that describes a referenced resource. In the proposed 

          solution, the services are based on the resource itself. As NISO OpenURL 

          is generic and extensible, it offers a flexible framework for the expression 

          of contextual dissemination requests. Although the authors have only 

          scratched the surface of the use of NISO OpenURL in the proposed solution, 

          it seems fair to state that it resonates nicely with MPEG-21 DIP, and 

          potentially MPEG-21 DIA.</p>

        <p>NISO OpenURL is also attractive in another sense. One of the core assumptions 

          made in the OpenURL Framework is the existence of a multitude of OpenURL 

          Resolvers, each of which can have its own behavior when responding to 

          OpenURL requests. Typically this behavior is based on the nature and/or 

          preferences of a community on whose behalf a Resolver operates. The 

          natively distributed and protocol-based nature of the proposed architecture 

          allows us to speculate on its deployment in a Web context. What was 

          described as the LANL Repository now becomes a federation of OAI-PMH 

          repositories distributed across the Web. In such a federation, components 

          such as the Repository Index, the Identifier Resolver and the OAI-PMH 

          Federator can play roles that are very similar to those described in 

          the context of the LANL Repository.  One can easily imagine the 

          existence of an OpenURL Resolver per institution in the federation. 

          As is the case in the OpenURL Framework that has successfully been deployed 

          for reference linking in the scholarly community, users would direct 

          dissemination requests to the OpenURL Resolver of their institution. 

          The institutional Resolver would respond to such requests by obtaining 

          a stored complex object from the appropriate OAI-PMH repository in the 

          federation. And, in a process similar to the one performed by the described 

          DIM Inserter, locally defined services could be attached to the object. 

          Actually, assuming the existence of globally unique identifiers for 

          digital formats, the addition of such services based on digital format 

          is not even difficult to imagine. The result is a framework in which 

          each institution of the federation can implement different preferences 

          with respect to the nature of the dissemination of the same content.</p>
