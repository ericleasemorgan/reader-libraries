<p>In 1994 the National Science Foundation launched its Digital Libraries
Initiative (DLI). The choice of combining the word <i>digital</i> with
<i>library</i> immediately defined three interested parties:
librarians, computer scientists, and publishers. The eventual impact
of the Initiative reached far beyond these three groups. The Google
search engine emerged from the funded work and has changed working
styles for virtually all professions and private activities that
involve a computer. The improved methods for searching video, which
the Initiative funded, have led to new approaches for detecting
longitudinal trends in nursing home occupant health (<i><a
href="http://www.informedia.cs.cmu.edu/caremedia/">CareMedia</a></i>).
Similarly, the Initiative has touched the work of <a
href="http://www.hpol.org/">historians</a>, <a
href="http://www.eskeletons.org/">anthropologists</a>, <a
href="http://www.oyez.org">political science and law</a>, and many other
professions.</p>

<p>
But one of the more intriguing aspects of the DLI was its matchmaking
coup of uniting librarians and computer scientists. Publishers were
and are on the scene, but triangles are complicated, and just
contemplating the binary union between academic librarians and
computer scientists is rich enough for one article. Between the two,
are there clear winners and losers after 10 years? Many would answer
this question with a vigorous nod.</p>

<H3>Computer Scientists' Expectations</H3>

<p>For computer scientists NSF's DL Initiative provided a framework for
exciting new work that was to be informed by the centuries-old
discipline and values of librarianship. The scientists had been
trained to use libraries since their years of secondary
education. They could see, or at least imagine how current
library functions would be moved forward by an injection of computing
insight.</p>

<p>
Digital library projects were for many computer scientists the perfect
relief from the tension between conducting 'pure' research and
impacting day-to-day society. Computing sciences are called on to
continually generate novelty. On the other hand, they experience both
their own desire, as well as funders' calls for deep impact on society
and neighboring scientific fields. Work on digital libraries promised
a perfect resolution of that tension.</p>

<H3>Librarians' Expectations</H3>

<p>For librarians the new Initiative was promising from two
perspectives. They had observed over the years that the natural
sciences were beneficiaries of large grants, while library operations
were much more difficult to fund and maintain. The Initiative would
finally be a conduit for much needed funds.</p>

<p>
Aside from the monetary issues, librarians who involved themselves in
the Initiative understood that information technologies were indeed
important to ensure libraries' continued impact on scholarly
work. Obvious opportunities lay in novel search capabilities, holdings
management, and instant access. Online Public Access Catalogs (OPACS)
constituted the entirety of digital facilities for many libraries. The
partnership with computer science would contribute the expertise that
was not yet widely available in the library community.</p>

<H3>The Cuckoo's Egg Surprise</H3>

<p>The DLI proposals had architected what looked like a reasonably
comfortable nest for the emerging union between the two
disciplines. But just as the happy couple set out to work, 
the World Wide Web pecked its way into the scene and demanded
attention while growing with astonishing rapidity.</p>

<p>
The Web's advent significantly changed many plans. The new
phenomenon's rapid spread propelled computer scientists and libraries
into unforeseen directions. Both partners suddenly had a somewhat
undisciplined teenager on their hands without the benefit of prior
toddler-level co-parenting.</p>

<p>
The coalition between the computing and library communities had been
anchored in a tacit understanding that even in the 'new' world there
would be coherent collections that one would operate on to search,
organize, and browse. The collections would include multiple media;
they would be larger than current holdings; and access methods would
change. But the scene would still include information consumers,
producers, and collections. Some strutting computer scientists
predicted the end of collection gatekeeping and mediation between
collections and their consumers; librarians in response clarified for
their sometimes naive computing partners just how much key information
is revealed in a reference interview. But other than these maybe
occasionally testy exchanges, the common vision of better and
more complete holdings prevailed.</p>

<p>
The Web not only blurred the distinction between consumers and
producers of information, but it dispersed most items that in the
aggregate should have been collections across the world and under
diverse ownership. This change undermined the common ground that had
brought the two disciplines together.</p>

<p>
For computer scientists this shift did not question the foundation of
their work. On the contrary, early results within the Initiative
projects had demonstrated a nagging downside of the existing DLI
research environment. That environment was bound into special deals
with publishers: the community could not truly share their results,
such as new user interfaces to collections. Sharing the results would
have required sharing access to the underlying collections, which were
freely accessible only to one individual university that had partnered
with a particular publisher. These restrictions were serious impediments, because computer scientists traditionally make their entire systems
public. Personal fame is made by building and freely distributing
entire operating systems (<a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>), storage facilities (<a
href="http://www.sleepycat.com/">Berkeley DB</a>), and user interface
toolkits (<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/piccolo/">Piccolo</a>).</p>

<p>
DLI researchers whose results were bound by per-project
agreements with publishers realized that they could only share teasers
with their colleagues. Copyright restrictions prevented access by a wider
audience. While well-circumscribed holdings are a source of pride in
the library world, the same concept therefore constricted the
traditions of computer scientists. Working on the Web removed these
restrictions.</p>

<p>
The embrace of the Web by computer scientists was natural also because
linkage of information is a much employed concept in computer
programming. The notion is taught in every second-year programming
class. The leap from linkage that is local to one machine, to linkage
across continents is therefore not so foreign to students of computer
science.</p>

<p>
Yet another factor that drew large numbers of computer scientists to
the area was that as the Web grew, machine learning, statistical, and
other heuristic approaches became applicable to information search and
organization. This broadening of relevance to additional
subdisciplines of computer science increased the number of researchers
and made what began under the name Digital Libraries an area with "sex
appeal" to many.</p>

<p>
For librarians the intrusion of the Web into the work on digital
libraries was much more difficult to integrate. Losing the notion of
collection in visions of the future threatened a weight-carrying
pillar of traditional librarianship. Now all that seemed left of the
original partnership with computer scientists were theoretical
computing algorithms without clear connection to recognizable,
traditional library functions.</p>

<p>
The disruption to the library community was greatly exacerbated by
many journal publishers' business decision to charge at a premium for
digital content. This decision has been forcing academic libraries to
cancel subscriptions, undermining their role as conduits to scholarly
work.</p>

<p>
In truth, however, both communities were fundamentally affected by a radical
change in attitude that the World Wide Web introduced. Many computer
scientists, most notably the database community, had shared with
librarians the value of data completeness, reliable availability, and
content integrity. Both communities considered predictable, repeatable
collection access and retrieval to be a prime value. The Web's
hyperabundance of duplication and content alternatives generated a
popular culture of laissez-faire retrieval. A wide sector of the
public was much less upset than one might have predicted by Web links
that led nowhere. The massive size of the Web makes up for local
failures.  The implications of these unruly information behaviors
still has both communities tumbling today.</p>

<p>
Far from enjoying immunity from the restrictions that tradition
imposes on older fields like library science, computer scientists
struggle with ambivalence towards the fruits of their own digital
revolution. At the same time that they herald online self-publishing
as the breakage of shackles from the tyranny of publishers, tenure
committees cannot wrestle themselves into granting the same respect to
online-only work that they afford traditional journal articles.</p>


<H3>Mutual (Mis?)Conceptions</H3>

<p>Amidst the stress of this destabilized common ground, a number of
complaints have been leveled among the partners. Some librarians had
expected DLI money to flow into collection building. Instead, they
perceive, computer scientists have hijacked the money and created an
environment whose connection to librarianship is unclear. Some felt
that their fast moving computing enthusiast partners too thoughtlessly
dismissed important functions, like collection development, as quaint.</p>

<p>
The impatient among computer scientists in turn could not understand
why librarians are so annoyingly deliberate about metadata, spending
years arguing about structures that the computer scientists felt would
be replaceable by just another clever search algorithm
improvement. Most of all, some computer scientists couldn't understand
why librarians couldn't be, well, normal computer scientists.</p>

<p>
So, has computer science swept across the information landscape like
the Vandals of old and left librarianship in ashes? This bleak
prediction is unwarranted. A number of developments call for a
brighter assessment. </p>

<p>
While information accession now rests on a highly technical
infrastructure, <b>the core function of librarianship remains</b>. The
information must be organized, collated, and presented. <a
href="http://highwire.stanford.edu">Highwire Press</a>, for example, provides not
merely a single keyword search field, but also an overview of
available resources, as well as browsing facilities.</p>

<p>
<b>The notion of collections is spontaneously re-emerging</b> in the
form of what computer scientists have named information <a
href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/345966.345982">'hubs.'</a> These new
incarnations of collections are Web sites whose primary goal is to
direct visitors to other Web sites that all specialize on the hub's
topic focus. (The hubs' topic-specific target sites are called
'authorities' in the literature). Quality hubs require curation. This
type of curation differs from its traditional cousin in that it must
cope with sometimes ephemeral material, and in that it requires a
different underlying skill set. The spirit of this function, however,
remains.</p>

<p>
Opportunities now arise for <b>direct connections between librarians
and scholarly authors</b>. The production of computer science
scholarly content has over the past ten years emerged into a prototype
for how other disciplines may soon generate their publication output:
Computer scientists are now expected to generate camera-ready copy of
their work. Of course, no camera is involved in final production. The
product instead moves directly online and into the hands of what should
be a new breed of librarians who add value to the product and maintain
hubs and online archives. Computer science authors and librarians have
thus moved to be direct neighbors in the publication workflow (see,
for example <a
href="http://www.theregister.com/2005/05/11/open_access_research/">Dutch
academics declare research free-for-all</a>). This closeness opens new
opportunities for librarians to expand their operations. For example,
librarians might over time reach back into the workflow and help
scholars who are not computer savvy produce output that works well in
an online world.</p>

<p>
The accomplishments of the Digital Libraries Initiative and many related
activities external to its work have broadened opportunities for
library science, rather than marginalizing the field. As models for
new libraries, like the <a href="http://portal.acm.org/">ACM Digital
Library</a> for computer science emerge, other scholarly fields will
follow suit and require help in developing their own styles of online
presence.</p>

<p>
Now, if only ACM librarians would stop making computer scientists
choose content descriptors from a controlled vocabulary of terms... Oh
well, in any union both sides need something that recalls their old
identity. In return, Web servers of flighty computer scientists get to
return their irresponsible "404 Not Found," which makes any librarians
worth their salt grit their teeth.</p>
