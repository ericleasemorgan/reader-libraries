The 5th European Networked Knowledge Organization Systems/Services
(NKOS) Workshop, organized by Traugott Koch, Douglas Tudhope, Marianne
Lykke Nielsen and Sebastian Ryszard Kruk took place on September 21 in
Alicante, Spain, as part of ECDL 2006. The full-day workshop was
attended by 30 colleagues from 18 countries on 4 continents.
All presentations are available on the Workshop website
&lt;<a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/nkos/nkos2006/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/nkos/nkos2006/</a>&gt;.
</p>

<p>
NKOS is a community of researchers, developers and practitioners seeking to enable knowledge organization systems (KOS) (e.g., classifications, gazetteers, lexical databases, ontologies, taxonomies and thesauri) as networked interactive terminology and knowledge organization services via the Internet.
</p>

<p>
A good number of submissions and thorough peer review resulted in
a high quality and comprehensive program. We managed to a certain degree to follow our ambitions to provide more focus and to expand discussion time. The regular common workshop dinner provided an opportunity for further discussion and planning active collaboration.
</p>

<p>
As usual, continuity and renewal characterized the event. We tend to follow certain groups and areas of work regularly over time and also manage to attract an equal number of new presenters and participants from NKOS, but also from related communities, such as Language Engineering and Linguistics, Metadata, Knowledge Management, Information Retrieval and Semantic Web. 
</p>

<p>
The first session of the workshop (chaired by Douglas Tudhope) discussed
the representation of and mapping between different KOS and the
provision of terminology web services.
Following up on earlier presentations at NKOS workshops, Margherita Sini talked  about the FAO's work with OWL (Web Ontology Language)
modelling of the multilingual AGROVOC thesaurus and continued steps
towards an Agriculture Ontology Service. Advanced solutions are necessary in such a large scale KOS and varied service application. OWL and SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organisation System) seem to offer at least important parts of the knowledge representation required.
</p>

<p>
Dennis Nicholson presented pilot web services solutions based on SRW (Search/Retrieve Web service) with the aim of making terminologies and mappings available, under
development in the present phase III of the UK HILT project.
</p>

<p>
Marianne Lykke Nielsen chaired the traditional user oriented session
(User participation and semantic components). 
Susan Price from Portland State University, USA, discussed the
evaluation of indexing efforts by professional users applying the
innovative semantic components model on the intersection between
traditional keyword indexing of complete documents and mark-up of text
segments.
</p>

<p>
Jean-Claude Ziswiler, University of Geneva, Switzerland, updated us on
recent developments related to the creation of hyperbooks from
information fragments using small domain ontologies: an empirical study
with students applying social usage-based weighting of semantic
relations between ontologies.
</p>

<p>
The full step "out" to participative user and community-based services,
previously not a focus of NKOS workshops, was taken by Jacob Voss from
Wikimedia Germany. He provided insights into the informal knowledge
organization growing collectively in the context of the wikipedias in
many languages, with surprising parallels to traditional knowledge
organisation systems (such as the DDC classification) and demonstrated
expected benefits from the application of established knowledge organization methods to
participatory knowledge systems. The discussion indicated that this
appears to be a very fruitful area of collaboration, certainly a regular theme in future NKOS workshops.
</p>

<p>
Through a formal cooperation with a group of European Union funded
projects in the field of the Semantic Web, this year's workshop offered a "Semantic Web Special Session", chaired by Bernhard Haslhofer. For several years, colleagues from the Semantic Web community have been
presenting at NKOS events. This year, several presentations referred to and applied selected technologies and approaches emanating from it. Sebastian Ryszard Kruk from the Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI) in Ireland presented building blocks
from several European projects, illustrating the role of ontologies in
creating what he calls "Semantic Digital Libraries". The goal of NKOS
has always been to show that Digital Libraries have to be "semantic";
otherwise they are not really libraries but rather piles of data.
</p>

<p>
Alistair Miles from CCLRC, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK, who has kept NKOS colleagues involved in the development of W3C's SKOS  RDF Schema throughout several years,
presented the outline of a Theory of Retrieval Using Structured
Vocabularies. The theory is also expected to assist in the next steps
towards the standardization of SKOS by enabling specification of formal
requirements via a comparative analysis of a set of use cases.
</p>

<p>
Session 4 (chaired by Traugott Koch) devoted considerable time, and engendered
lively discussions, to a major focus topic of this workshop: a further
development of a KOS Typology. Douglas Tudhope, University of Glamorgan
in Wales, presented earlier and increasingly elaborate efforts (NKOS has dealt with the issue since 2000) and proposed new i.e., faceted and use context related approaches towards a KOS of KOS. The
principle usefulness of a typology (as opposed to a registry of KOS
instances) and the scope of such a typology were debated especially.
</p>

<p>
Important work was on display as well in the usual concluding briefing
session (chair: Stella Dextre Clarke) about ongoing projects. Close to
being papers in their own right, the briefings might well evolve into full papers for next year's NKOS workshop.
</p>

<p>
Marianne Lykke Nielsen, from the Royal School of Library and Information
Science in Denmark, presented a case study comparing manual and
automated indexing in the context of workplace information retrieval,
with surprising results.
Lois Delcambre, Portland State University, showed an approach for exploring intrinsic organization of knowledge as contained in user interfaces.
Stella Dextre Clarke  provided an update of the work being done to revise the UK BSI Standard  on "Structured vocabularies for information retrieval", now focusing on the parts addressing multilingual vocabularies, mapping, and formats and protocols for interoperability. Contributions were invited.
</p>

<p>
One highly welcome and provocative presentation was by Martin Doerr, from ICS FORTH in Greece, who asked us to "wake up from our dogmatic slumber" and to follow his alternative approach to knowledge management for Digital Libraries.
</p>

<p>
Several presentations and themes resulted in ambitions for practical
collaboration efforts: a NKOS task force is expected to carry forward
the work to further scope and develop a typology and an approach to a
registry of KOS. Cooperative efforts will assist in the description of
use cases and the further modelling of the mapping methodology in SKOS.
It is hoped that many NKOS colleagues will contribute to the further evolution
of standards for structured vocabularies.

The main forum for all of this is the international NKOS discussion
list. Information about how to subscribe and to share the work is available at the

Recently, a special issue on NKOS, based upon earlier NKOS workshops,
was published by the "New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia" (see the journal website &lt;<a href="http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/13614568.asp">http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/13614568.asp</a>&gt;).
