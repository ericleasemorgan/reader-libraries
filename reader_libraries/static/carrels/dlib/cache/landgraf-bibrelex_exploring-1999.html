Traditional searching and browsing functions for
bibliographic databases no longer enable users to deal
efficiently with the rapidly growing number of scientific publications.
The main goal of our project <em> BibRelEx</em> is to develop a new method 
based on the visualization of content-based relations between documents such 
as <em> cites</em>, <em> succeeds</em>, <em>improves with respect to</em>.
BibRelEx will therefore use these relationships for effective exploration. In addition, BibRelEx will take advantage of the additional insights into the
area that can result from the aggregation of expert knowledge,
which complements the specialized knowledge represented in the
documents themselves. We are preparing to test this approach using
a bibliographic database in a specific area of computer science.

<P><H3>1. Introduction</H3>

<P>
It is well-known how difficult it is to find relevant literature using only 
the conventional retrieval methods. Often one needs a survey article to get  quick access to a certain area or to discover the central 
publications in a particular area. Here 
<strong> content-based</strong> relations between documents such as the 
<em> citation relation</em> are helpful. For example, one can detect survey articles
by the fact that they cite many papers in a given area, whereas 
fundamental contributions are cited by many. Also, thematically related 
documents can easily be determined with the help of the citation relation  
since they have similar citations.

<P>
The answers to queries concerning content-based relations could, in principle,
be output in textual form as lists. However, the following query demonstrates the 
value of a <strong> graphical visualization of relationships</strong>: 
<em> What further work has been influenced by a given publication <I>A</I>?</em> 
The result set for this query could be visualized -- as shown in Figure 
<A HREF="11landgraf.html#pinfluence">1</A> -- by a graph whose nodes represent the documents that directly or 
indirectly cite document <I>A</I>, and whose edges express the citation relation, 
resulting in an at-a-glance picture of <I>A</I>'s sphere of influence. In this example,
documents are represented by keys like <I>b-ct-93</I> 
that are derived from the 
author's names, the title of the document, and the year of appearance.

<P>
<A NAME=104>&#160;</A><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="Influence of a publication" SRC="influence-reduced.gif" width="610" height="424">
<BR><STRONG>Figure 1:</STRONG> <A NAME=pinfluence>&#160;</A>Influence of a publication (<a href="11Influence-image.html" target="_blank">View</a> a larger version of 
Figure 1 in a separate window.)<BR>
<P>

Under the citation relation, documents are arranged by fields
of knowledge, independently of their language and of the words that happen 
to occur in titles or keywords. Thus, 
two substantial problems that are common with classical retrieval 
methods are avoided: the selection of suitable search words and the consideration 
of the context.

<P>
When searching for information, the advice of human experts in the respective 
area is valuable. For example, an expert can point to the few best publications 
in an area without providing an exhaustive list of less valuable material. 
Since human experts are not always around,
it is highly desirable that such expert knowledge be integrated into 
the database. We suggest enriching the database by <strong> public annotations
contributed by expert users</strong>, that can be attached to documents or to relations 
between documents.
The relations annotated may be formal, e.g., <em> cites</em>, or more generally
content-based, so that it would be hard to automatically extract them from the documents.
For instance, a new document <I>B</I> could in a specific way 
generalize a document <I>A</I> that is already available in the database; see 
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="11landgraf.html#paddannot">2</A>.

<BR><STRONG>Figure 2:</STRONG> <A NAME=paddannot>&#160;</A>Incorporation of a generalization relation into the database<BR>
<P>
<P>
Not only does BibRelEx provide the means for entering public annotations; our system also
allows all users actively working in a scientific area
to customize their information spaces by adding their own views 
as <strong> private information</strong>. This could be achieved,
for example, by entering additional publications into the database that are frequently referred to by the user, or by subjective annotations like the following:

<UL>
<LI> The citation of document <I>Y</I> in document <I>X</I> is relevant. 
   
<LI> Document <I>X</I> contains a particularly good representation of technique <I>T</I>.
</UL>

<P>
There exist many individual solutions for particular aspects of
visualization, knowledge management, and collaboration. With our project,
BibRelEx, we will for the first time integrate most of these techniques. 
To summarize: With BibRelEx, content-based relations between documents such as
<em> cites</em>, <em> succeeds</em>, <em> improves with respect to</em> can be
visualized and used for a more efficient exploration. In addition, we 
encourage users to attach their own annotations to documents or to pairs of 
related documents. Such annotations may be either private or public. The 
aggregation of public annotations contributed by expert users represents 
insight into the area that exceeds the knowledge that is represented in the 
documents themselves.

<P>
In order to test our ideas in a real application, we are building BibRelEx on top of
the bibliographic database <em>geombib</em>, which is described in 
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="11landgraf.html#geombib">3</A>. The restriction to this particular field enables us to enter -- in addition to the citation relation -- some 
content-based relations based on expert knowledge.
Although our focus in this project is on a particular bibliographic database 
in a specific field, BibRelEx is developed in such a way that it can easily be 
applied to other fields of knowledge and other databases, or to digital 
libraries.

<P>
<H3>2. Related Work</H3>

<P>
Following up the references contained in a scientific document has
always been an essential part of systematic study. It is not surprising
that several systems or projects exist that aim to support
some of the features built into BibRelEx.

<P>
Well known is the <em> Science Citation Index(SCI)</em> [<A HREF="11landgraf.html#sciurl">ISI</A>], 
which lists all publications cited by a document. 
In addition, the SCI offers additional search options. 
There is a register of all cited authors (citation index), which 
enables the following type of forward search: One can ask in which publications a selected 
author is cited. In addition to the bibliographic citation of a paper, SCI also shows the 
bibliography written by the author. Thus, a backward type of
search is also possible.

<P>
D.M. Jones [<A HREF="11landgraf.html#jhbp95">Jon95</A>] has originated the 
<em> Hypertext Bibliography Project</em>. A Web-based system, it  employs
hypertext links to establish citations, and sets up one Web page per document 
containing a list of links to papers that cite it.
This project is already well under way. It covers a selection
of major journals and conferences. Keyword search and access by author
name are supported. The abstracts for many documents are available
on-line.

<P>
The Trier Computer Science Bibliography 
DBLP is a related project. Ley&nbsp;[<A HREF="11landgraf.html#ltib97">Ley97</A>]&nbsp;took over parts of data from 
the Hypertext Bibliography Project to supplement his database. So far, all references
contained in the conference proceedings of PODS, SIGMOND, VLDB, and in the magazine 
<em> The Data Engineering Bulletin</em>, and part of the references from
the TODS magazine, have been entered.

<P>
R.D. Cameron [<A HREF="11landgraf.html#cucdcr97">Cam97</A>] suggests building a
<em> universal citation database</em> that links all publications ever written
through their citations. He discusses a distributed approach
for such a database, using different servers for different sources such as
journals, conferences, etc. In order to make searching over the Internet as 
efficient as possible, each server has to manage both the bibliographic 
data and citation references from and to the publications stored.

<P>
For the implementation of relation networks, hypertext systems 
like <em> HyperWave</em> [<A HREF="11landgraf.html#MaurerHyperWave">Mau96</A>] are well-suited; they can manage both 
annotations and relations between documents.

<P>
Although representing relations explicitly by hyperlinks is a flexible 
method, it creates a few problems. Hyperlinks can be unstable 
and need to be conscientiously maintained. There may be a number of copies 
or versions of the same document in different formats, e.g., Postscript, PDF, HTML. 
These problems, and some basic approaches, are discussed in a D-Lib Magazine article by Caplan and Arms  
[<A HREF="11landgraf.html#carlja99">CA99</A>]. The International DOI Foundation proposes to use Digital 
Object Identifiers (DOI) [<A HREF="11landgraf.html#ddppsp98">DD98</A>, <A HREF="11landgraf.html#pdcso99">Pas99</A>] instead of URLs. A DOI is 
a persistent identifier for managing copyrighted material. 
SLinkS [<A HREF="11landgraf.html#hslsf99">Hel99</A>] is an  intermediary service which uses a URL templating 
language to construct a URL based on bibliographic data and metadata, to give 
information about what the URL leads to and how it may be used.

<P>
Furthermore, there are some projects concerning automatic citation indexing,
for instance, see Bollacker, et al., and Hitchcock, et al., [<A HREF="11landgraf.html#blgcawaa98">BLG98</A>, <A HREF="11landgraf.html#hchhpeblejlo98">HCH+98</A>]. BibRelEx differs
from these projects in that our focus is not on the creation of the indexes, but in the effective use of citation indices in literature search. In addition,
we will exploit more flexible content-based 
relations that result by aggregation of expert knowledge.

<P>
To our knowledge, there is, at present, only one system that enables a global 
overview based on literature references. With <em> VxInsight</em> of 
Sandia&nbsp;[<A HREF="11landgraf.html#sandia">DHJ+98</A>] fields of knowledge are 
represented as landscapes, over which the user can fly using virtual reality 
techniques. The deeper one flies, the more sub-areas become visible. On the 
lowest level, the titles of the journal articles are represented. The mapping 
algorithm clusters documents by the number of common citations the papers list.
The citation data were taken from the Science Citation Index 
mentioned above.

<P>
<H3><A NAME=geombib>3. The Bibliographic Database Geombib</A></H3>

<P>
Before we present the design of BibRelEx, a brief description of the sample the bibliographic database <em> geombib</em> [<A HREF="11landgraf.html#ejs98geombib">EJS98</A>] that
we are currently using is in order.  At the time our project started,      
geombib contained about 8700 bibliographic
entries in the area of computational geometry. It references magazine 
articles, conference contributions, and
technical reports. All entries are in BibTeX format; this is one of the reasons
why geombib became so popular, because this format helps users create their own
bibliographies in LaTeX documents.

<P>
Geombib is being maintained by B. Jones of the University of Saskatchewan,
and it is updated by a community effort. Typically, users download the whole database which consists of a
single file. To the local copy, users can add new entries
of recent publications, or correct incomplete or erroneous entries.
After four months,
the resulting file is compared against the original one, and the differences
are submitted to the administrator. From the data submitted, a new release
is compiled and distributed one month later.

<P>
This approach works surprisingly well, thanks to the effort of many
researchers who do not shrink from entering whole proceedings volumes.
As a result, the database covers most of the existing publications in
this field, including technical reports and workshop proceedings.

<P>
<H3>4. BibRelEx</H3>
<P>
<strong>4.1 BibConsist and BibManage</strong>
<P>
Once the decision for building BibRelEx on top of an existing
database had been made,
two consequences were immediate. First, the system had to be designed
in such a way that geombib in its current form and BibRelEx could 
coexist; geombib as it currently exists has to remain fully operational.
Second, we also had to provide
a critical mass of citation information and annotations, so that geometers
can use the new exploration methods to their advantage.

<P>
In order to exploit content-based relations among documents for
navigation, the relations themselves must be present in the database.
Geombib already provides, for each database entry, optional fields
named <em> cites, precedes, succeeds, annote</em>, but less
than ten percent of them have so far been filled in.

<P>
Therefore, we started our project by entering the citations
contained in the proceedings of the large conferences (SoCG, CCCG,  etc.).
While most of the papers published in the proceedings were already represented 
in geombib, much of the cited work was not; together, about 1500 new entries 
were generated and about 4850 links filled in.

<P>
When inserting new data records, we encountered a problem. In 
geombib, each entry is identified by a unique key, which is generated 
according to fixed rules from the authors' names, the initial 
characters of the significant words in the title, and the year of appearance. 
Upon insertion into geombib, duplicate keys are detected automatically. 
However, it is not uncommon that data-entry errors result in duplicates that 
give rise to different keys. This happens, for example, if the authors' names
have been entered in different order, so that the keys generated by geombib
differ. Also, misspelling the paper's title can result in different keys.

<P>
In order to detect such duplicates, we have developed the tool 
<em> BibConsist</em>&nbsp;[<A HREF="11landgraf.html#BibConsistWeb">Lan97</A>]. It checks if the corresponding fields 
of two entries have similar contents. D. Knuth's soundex 
code&nbsp;[<A HREF="11landgraf.html#KnuthArt3">Knu73</A>] is used for measuring the phonetic similarity of words.
Using BibConsist we were able to detect many duplicates in geombib.

<P>
BibConsist can be used twice in the update cycle of geombib. First, at 
merging time, the administrator can use it to detect duplicates in all updates 
suggested by the users and to guarantee the consistency of the new geombib release. 
Second, while creating and formatting entries, 
BibConsist can be used to prevent users from entering faulty records.

<P>
In the four-month period between two geombib releases the user typically
maintains a local version of the database that contains all recent updates
suggested by the user. In addition, many
users are maintaining their own bibliographic databases containing
the data of such publications that are interesting to them, and that are likely
to be cited in their own work, but do not necessarily belong to
the area of computational geometry (for example, a textbook on topology
from which but one theorem is quoted).

<P>
In order to keep these different databases consistent, we are currently
developing the tool BibManage for maintaining public and private local 
versions of the database under periodic updates. Each time a new release of 
geombib appears, this tool checks whether it contains all updates suggested by the 
user. In case an update was suggested but has not been performed by the administrator,
the users can choose whether to submit their suggestions again  
or insert a corresponding entry into their personal bibliographies. BibManage also 
checks whether some documents contained in the personal bibliography do now appear 
in geombib, due to some other user's request. Such entries are then removed. 
Furthermore, the tool guarantees transparency between updates, in that 
all local databases are treated like a single 
one. Internally, however, the
personal bibliography and the update database have priority over the current
geombib version. 
New update suggestions to be submitted to the administrator are automatically
created by BibManage.

<P>
In addition, a user interface for editing existing records and entering new 
records, annotations and relations into either database is provided.

<P>
Altogether BibManage supports the update process of geombib in the following 
three situations:
<UL><LI> merge of a new geombib version; 
<LI> support of the user in working with geombib and personal bibliographic 
      databases;
<LI> automatic creation of the file containing the updating suggestions. 
</UL>
Figure <A HREF="11landgraf.html#updatecycle">3</A> shows the use of BibConsist and BibManage in the 
updating cycle of geombib.

<P><strong>4.2 Visualization</A></strong>

<P>
As was pointed out in the introduction, visualizing the content-based
relations among documents is a key issue in our approach.
We have examined a number of visualization systems in order to find a
system suitable for BibRelEx. Such a system
should enable a three-dimensional representation of relation
networks and offer comfortable navigation methods. Moreover, it should be 
possible for the user to select nodes and edges by
mouse-clicks, thus displaying, in a text window, further information 
like the full bibliographic entry or annotations attached to the object.

<P>
Well suited layout algorithms for our purposes are force-directed
algorithms such as the spring embedder&nbsp;[<A HREF="11landgraf.html#kfsmapn94">KF94</A>, <A HREF="11landgraf.html#sagda96">Sim96</A>].
This algorithm is based on the simulation of a mechanical process. 
Nodes carry mutually repulsive charges, and edges are modeled by
springs that strive to contract. Initially, all nodes are placed
randomly. Then a series of iterations are performed in which the nodes
move in space conditioned by the forces until a minimum energy state
of the system is reached. This state 
corresponds to a proper layout.  In the resulting graph,
highly-connected nodes are placed close to each other.
Applied to citation networks this means that the cluster
of nodes represent documents that have similar references.  Thus the
user can easily detect which documents are related by content.

<P>
In its original form, the spring embedder algorithm gives good results 
only for small-sized graphs. With large graphs, heuristic methods must be
employed in order to achieve an acceptable run time behavior. One 
achieves good results with the GEM3D-Algorithmus&nbsp;[<A HREF="11landgraf.html#BrFr95">BF95</A>], which
uses an additional "virtual temperature" for the adjustment of nodes.

<P>
The visualization system should also be able to cooperate easily
with BibManage in order to combine the classical retrieval
methods offered by BibManage with the visual study of the
information space.

<P>
Unfortunately, it seems that no system exists at present that
completely fulfills our request. Therefore, we decided to use the
LEDA library for implementing a large part of the
functionality described above. LEDA provides basic data structures for
graphs, numerous geometrical algorithms and components for the
creation of a user interface. In addition, LEDA is extendable.
Figure <A HREF="11landgraf.html#pleda">4</A> has been produced with LEDA; it shows part of the
citation net that is contained in geombib at present. Represented are
those documents that contain the word "Voronoi" in their titles. Only
such documents are considered which refer again to other
documents. In the figure, one can easily detect  "cd-vdbcd-85" as a
central work.  


<P><A NAME=112>&#160;</A><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="Representation of a citation net with LEDA" SRC="leda-revised.gif" width="600" height="476">

Figure 4 in a separate window.)<BR>



<P><strong>4.3 Future Work</A></strong></p>

<P>
As of today, LEDA offers some support for three-dimensional graph representation. 
A three-dimensional spring embedder is available;
however, it is rather slow for our purposes. Only a reduced set of navigation 
methods is offered. Therefore, in our next step
we will start to extend the
representation of diagrams. For example, we will incorporate a faster layout
algorithm, e.g., GEM3D. To obtain better means of navigation, we will test the following approach: convert the
layout produced by LEDA into a VRML file and then use a 
VRML Viewer such as VRwave. Since we want to combine the
visualization with classical retrieval methods, we must check whether
this method provides a sufficiently dynamic layout.

<P>
Parallel to this implementation work, the database must be extended
in such a way that a critical mass of information is available, 
making the use of BibRelEx worthwhile to the geometry community. Due to
our previous efforts, there are at present about 13,000 references available
in geombib, surely enough to test the system under a real load. To provide
additional content-based relations based on expert knowledge,
we will sift the available literature in the areas of
Voronoi diagrams and on-line algorithms, put these publications in relation 
to each other, and annotate them.

<P>
Another interesting question is how to maintain the database contents
over time. We feel that this task should no longer be left to
volunteers. Rather, we suggest that the authors themselves submit,
along with their papers, a proposal for an annotated geombib entry
to a conference or to a journal. The referees could, without additional
effort, check whether the proposed entry is correct and complete
and then forward it to the database manager. This approach, which has also
been suggested by Cameron&nbsp;[<A HREF="11landgraf.html#cucdcr97">Cam97</A>], is in the
authors' best interest.
