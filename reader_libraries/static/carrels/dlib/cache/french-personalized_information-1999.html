</p>

<p><font color="#000066">A Personalized Information Environment or "PIE" is a conceptual
architecture that allows unified, highly customizable
access to distributed information resources by providing users the
tools to compose personalized collections from a palette of
information resources. The architecture also provides for the
efficient exchange of inter-resource meta-information like
collection statistics in order to maximize retrieval effectiveness. 
We identify four conceptual requirements for a PIE: customizability,
efficient and effective search, controlled sharability, and privacy
and security. Specific technologies needed to achieve these
requirements in practice include distributed object systems, resource
summarization tools, and integrated security and privacy mechanisms.
This paper includes the enunciation of the user-centered PIE vision,
an architectural requirements specification, and an architectural
description that meets the specification and supports the vision. We
also describe our current implementation and research efforts
conducted within the PIE framework.</font></p>



<P>
In 1945, Vannevar Bush [<A
 HREF="06french.html#bus-am45">2</A>] first described an information
environment that he felt was bordering on the unmanageable, with
information users awash in research results and scholarly
communication and few usable mechanisms to organize them. 
Bush felt that current mechanisms for dealing with information
were wholly inadequate given the volume of work being produced:</p>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the results
of research are generations old and by now are totally inadequate for
their purpose. ... Those who conscientiously attempt to keep abreast
of current thought, even in restricted fields, by close and continuous
reading might well shy away from an examination calculated to show how
much of the previous month's efforts could be produced on call. (p. 101)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

From this line of thought, Bush then developed his vision of
the "Memex", a tool that would allow its user to note, bookmark,
and otherwise organize information in whatever fashion made most sense
to that user.</p> 

<P>
Visionary in its scope, the Memex continues to give motivation
and direction to a large amount of research in information storage and
retrieval. It is abundantly clear that today the Memex might help
immeasurably in stemming the increasing tide of information. While
mechanisms to generate information continue to grow in number and
sophistication, tools and techniques to manage, filter, and search lag
behind.  The level of care taken in the preparation of information for
online publication varies greatly.  Access to the information is often
poor. Even awareness of the existence of specific data is becoming
increasingly difficult. Organizational strategies provided by
information publishers are publisher-centric or designed to meet the
needs of a specific user group.</p>

<P>
What is needed are tools that will enable users to create
personal collections of information resources of interest to
them.  It will be necessary to cull tens of thousands of
resources for those of specific interest; it will also be
necessary to continuously monitor available resources to
detect new useful sources or to decide that others
are no longer of interest.  Efficient search strategies are
required to support the discovery of resources and to search
and fuse information gleaned from those resources.</p>

<P>
In this paper, we present our vision of a user-centered, user-organized
information space called a <i>Personalized Information Environment</i> or
PIE. In contrast to a typical Internet search of multiple information
resources, where control of which resources are searched is in the
search engine's hands, a PIE places the control in the user's
hands. In the PIE formulation, descriptions of resources are made
available to users and they decide which resources to include in a
search. The process of resource selection is highly interactive and
might involve sample searches and then selection or de-selection of
resources from the user's current personalized collection. Regardless
of the degree of interactivity, efficient and effective search is
provided within whatever context the current collection of resources
defines. Since users may spend considerable effort customizing their
personal resource collection, it makes sense to allow sharing of the
collection in constrained ways or using pre-defined policies while
maintaining whatever privacy or security constraints might be placed
on particular resources or users. Thus, there are four driving
principles behind the PIE:</p> 
<p>
<UL>
<LI>
Customizability;
<LI>
Efficient and Effective Search;
<LI>
Controlled Sharability; and
<LI>
Privacy and Security.
</UL></p>

<P>
We believe current solutions and techniques are lacking to some degree
along all four of these dimensions. The Personalized Information
Environment provides a framework within which alternatives along all
of these dimensions can be explored.</p>

<A NAME="sec-pie">&#160;</A><BR>
Personalized Information Environments
</H3>

<P>
A variety of forces in today's information environment combine to
(1) make current modes for dealing with information inadequate
<i>and</i> (2) suggest new modes that may provide for more effective
use.</p> 

<P>
As many have noted, there is a continuous, ever-increasing flood of
information of all types, quality, and formats. The technology to
generate and deliver this information digitally has vastly outstripped
the technology to analyze and process it. Information recipients 
have only coarse-grained control over the
information flow -- it can be turned on and off, but it is difficult
to throttle it to the desired level. For example, Larsen
[<A
 HREF="06french.html#lar-dlib97">19</A>] notes the need for alternative methods for looking
at search because, among other reasons, the increasing size of on-line
information assures that increasing numbers of documents fit the query
criteria. The result: a query that once yielded tens of hits now yields
thousands.</p> 

<P>
In addition, the current multi-collection search engines are relatively
crude in their capabilities, both to selectively search subsets of
collections and to merge the accompanying results. Duplicate
detection, while an active area of research [<A
 HREF="06french.html#gra-pdis96">13</A>], is
still in its infancy.</p>

<P>
There is, however, reason for hope. For example, we are just beginning
to try to exploit the fact that users have different needs, desires,
and operational modes and to recognize that relevance means different
things in different situations. Given a particular task, two people
may approach execution of that task in totally different ways. While
designing, building, and evaluating systems that enable and facilitate
such diversity is difficult, there is also a considerable opportunity
to make real progress in controlling information overload.</p>

<P>
In addition, technological capacity (i.e., memory capacity, chip densities,
and network bandwidth) continues to obey Moore's law, essentially 
doubling every 18  to 24 months. Thus, it is restrictive to allow
perceived resource limitations to constrain how we think about potential
solutions.</p> 

<P>

<Strong><A NAME="SECTION00011000000000000000">
Current Distributed Search Architectures</A>
</Strong></p>
<p>The particular operational scenario that we are concerned with
involves information retrieval over multiple information resources,
where these resources are distributed and autonomous. They provide
a search interface to users, but the internal workings of the resource
are not readily available. This multi-database/multi-collection search
scenario is a familiar one in today's Internet/WWW environment.</p>

<P>
The current state-of-the-art in multi-database search can be seen in
the two prevalent search architectures available today on the Web (see
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="06french.html#fig-search-arch">1</A>). The
first architecture, which we call the Centralized View, attempts to
collect information about all documents in the information universe
into a single, possibly replicated database. Searches are then
performed on a logically single server and results with document
pointers are returned to the user. This architectural view is embodied
in Web Search engines like Lycos, Infoseek, Yahoo, and
Excite. The Centralized View is the logical first step in trying to
provide access to distributed document collections. There are
many problems with the view including the following.</p>

<P> <UL> <LI> Scale - Ultimately there are too many documents being
produced to expect that they (or their surrogates) will reside at any
single location.</LI></p>

<P> <LI> Heterogeneity/homogeneity - While data indexed by the search
engines is vastly heterogeneous in content and information structure,
it is essentially of a single type -- HTML web pages.</LI></p>

<P> <LI> Dynamicity - With few exceptions, search engines index only
static HTML pages -- the vast amounts of data for which a web page is
only an entry-point are not accessible.</LI></p>

<P> <LI> Currency - Because the centralized index is far removed from
its constituent sources, many links are stale and many pages are out
dated.</LI></p>

<P> <LI> Privacy/Security - Providers that have privacy or security
concerns generally elect not to participate in these services.</LI></p>

<P> <LI> Property - Providers that have intellectual property concerns
or who might want to be compensated for their information generally
elect not to participate.</LI></p>  </UL></p>

             Two distributed search architectures. The centralized 
             view (left) maintains a global index of documents
             downloaded from a large number of resources. The
             meta-searcher architecture searches several centralized
             indexes and combines results into a single list of hits.
</CAPTION>
</TABLE>
</DIV><BR>
<P>
The second view, which we call the Meta-Searcher view, is embodied in
systems like MetaCrawler
(<a href="http://www.metacrawler.com/">http://www.metacrawler.com/</a>).
In this architecture, several
Centralized search engines are encapsulated in a single common system
with a common interface. The meta-searcher must take a user query, 
send it to each of the engines in its system, collect the results, and
present them to the user in an intelligent manner.</p> 

<P>
In addition to the problems associated with the Centralized View,
there are additional problems with the current generation of
meta-searchers. Because the inner workings of the search engines are
not readily available, intelligent merging of results that present
(document, query) similarities on subtly or vastly different scales is
difficult. Even if two search engines use the exact same search
engine, simple collation of the results can yield sub-par results
[<A
 HREF="06french.html#vil-sigir95">24</A>]. The STARTs proposal [<A
 HREF="06french.html#gra-sigmod97">11</A>] for
meta-data publication was one mechanism to address this problem, though
work still needs to be done to verify that proposals like STARTs specify 
the needed information to support effective retrieval.</p>

<P>
Another big problem with the current meta-searcher paradigm is the
general lack of flexibility and customizability from the user
view. Users are usually provided with a small, coarse grained set of
options for performing search. For example, a meta-searcher will allow
selection of the particular set of resources to search. Of course,
each of these components is itself a centralized index with a 
very large, hetergeneous corpus, so all the central index problems
mentioned previously still apply.</p>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00012000000000000000">
Personalized Information Environments</A>
</H3>
We are faced with the following situation: information overwhelms us;
users differ in their personal tastes and work modes;
multi-collection search is crude and prone to ineffective results; and
computers, disks, memory, and networks continue their exponential
increase in capacity. This confluence of factors suggests a new
architecture that addresses many of the problems we have been
discussing. We call this architecture a <i>Personalized Information
Environment</i> (PIE). A PIE is a system that allows users to build their
own multi-collections -- ones that are suited to their own particular
needs and tasks. We call such a multi-collection a <i>Personalized
Collection</i> (PeC).</p>  

<P>
In the PIE world, users select from lists of known databases or
information resources to build their own multi-collection. Once a PeC
has been constructed, then the resources within the PeC must
"cooperate" to ensure effective search. (We will have more to say
about this cooperation shortly.) Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="06french.html#fig-pec">2</A> depicts one
realization of a PeC.</p>

<P>
Centralized search engines and their derivatives take a
multi-dimensional, heterogeneous information world and flatten it into
a single, huge information mass. Search then proceeds on the mass. The
PIE allows browsing, searching, and filtering closer to the origin of
the information, eschewing the centralized mass and going directly to
the resource for searching. What will make a PIE tractable is the
provision of powerful resource summarization tools that will allow a
user to easily choose which resources should and should not be in
their personal collections, combined with domain and user specific
heuristics for further pruning of the search space. We believe that
meta-searchers have the right philosophy in allowing users to select
the indexes they search -- but this selection needs to take place
closer to the information source with the system providing meaningful
support in the selection process.</p>

Requirements - Towards a Working PIE
</H3>
We now describe a set of requirements for a full-featured, working
PIE, dividing these requirements up into conceptual and operational
requirements.</p> 

<P>

<Strong><A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="sub-require-concept">&#160;</A><BR>
Conceptual Requirements
</Strong></p>

<p>There are four central conceptual requirements that embody the
Personalized Information Environment: customizability, effective
search, sharability, and privacy.</p>

<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Customizability.</B>
We envision a PIE as having tools that allow users to easily design
and compose PeCs. The building process is iterative. One can select a
group of resources, send a query, evaluate the results and then
adjust the PeC accordingly. The PIE would have auxiliary information
such as topic maps or resource summaries that allow users to more
intelligently select resources.</p>

<P>
<LI><B>Effective Search.</B>
Users still want effective search, so a PeC must dynamically alter its
context as resources are added or removed. The main idea is that
search should take place in a context derived from the contents or
properties of the resources that are in the PeC at the time of the
search, not in the separate local contexts of the PeC constituents.</li></p>

<P>
<LI>
<B>Sharability.</B>
PeCs should be sharable. Since there may be considerable curatorial effort
expended in building a PeC, it is logical that they might be shared and
re-used. The original builder might design a core PeC and then add a
small number of resources for particular tasks. The PeC might be used
by a number of people with interests in the same area, or who are
working on the same project together. Sharing could be via reference
to a single existing PeC or via copying.</li></p>

<P>
<LI>
<B>Security. </B>
Sharability also implies access control. For a variety of reasons, a
PeC owner may want to control access. The owner may have paid a
fee to some of the constituent resources in order to gain access, or
the PeC may be related to a proprietary or otherwise sensitive
task. From the searcher's point of view, protection of usage and query
patterns may be important.</li></p>

Operational Requirements
</Strong></p>

<p>Any instantiation of a PIE naturally leads to some operational
requirements. We identify these below.</p>

<P><strong>
<A NAME="SECTION00022100000000000000">
1. Distributed Object Systems</A>
</Strong></p>

<p>In a PIE based world, the cross-product of many users and many PeCs
demands a distributed processing approach. An information resource
can be a participant in a number of PeCs and a number of PIEs.
Given this possibility, a resource (or its surrogate) will be a remote
participant in at least some PeCs and some PIEs. Managing the associated
complexity of distributed communication and processing is therefore
very important.</p>

<P>
Distributed object systems are a natural mechanism to implement and manage a
PIE. Object orientation means that communication between objects is
based upon method invocation and not on lower-level
primitives like send and receive. The run-time layer of the distributed
object system manages the important details of object location and 
instantiation, method invocation, and even object migration.</p> 

<P>

<Strong><A NAME="SECTION00022200000000000000">
2. Resource Summarization Tools</A>
</Strong></p>

<p>A usable PIE must provide tools that allow users to easily compose
various resources into coherent PeCs. Mechanisms to tersely summarize the
holdings of resources are needed so that users can aggregate these
resources intelligently. The PIE can provide some default
resource aggregations, or it can provide summarizations that allow the
user to compose a PeC interactively. These tools must be highly
interactive: it should be easy to insert and delete a resource and to have
that modification quickly reflected in a subsequent search and in the
collection statistics that are used for that search.</p>

<P>

<Strong><A NAME="SECTION00022300000000000000">
3. Security Mechanisms</A>
</Strong></p>

<p>For reasons that were described above the PIE must
support constrained sharability (i.e., sharing within a group) while
also providing access control. The mechanism for providing these
services should be flexible enough to support multiple policy types
and, relative to particular PeCs or resources, changes in policy types
over time.</p>

Architecture
</H3>
We are now ready to describe an architecture that combines PIEs, PeCs,
users, and information resources in a coherent and meaningful way. Our
description is constructive, first describing how various entities fit and
then building from these smaller blocks to show the overall
architecture.</p>

<P>

<Strong><A NAME="SECTION00031000000000000000">
Virtual Repositories</A>
</Strong></p>

<p>As we mentioned previously, information resources must cooperate to
ensure effective search. What is the nature of this cooperation?
Clearly we cannot expect that each resource keep track of every PeC to
which it belongs. There may be millions of PeCs. Yet we do need the
resource to export its local context in some way so effective PeC-wide
search can be conducted. The PIE architecture addresses this concern
in the following way.</p>

<p>For each resource, there is a "front-end" called a Virtual
Repository(VIRP). The main task of a VIRP is to export a common
interface to PeCs and other objects that may have an interest in the
resource. The VIRP is logically a single entity -- there is only one
per information resource. Of course, such wrapping of heterogeneous
resources is hardly new -- for example, Paepcke, et al.
[<A
 HREF="06french.html#pae-computer96">21</A>, <A
 HREF="06french.html#pae-computer99">20</A>] use it to provide base level
interoperability between disparate resources via a "Library Service
Proxy".</p>
<p>
<Strong><A NAME="SECTION00032000000000000000">
Personal Collections and Resource Descriptions</A>
</Strong></p>

<p>When constructing a PeC, a user selects resources or groups of resources
to populate the PeC (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="06french.html#fig-pec">2</A>). 
For each resource, a <i>Resource Description</i> (RD) is created that
functions as a kind of liaison between the PeC and the VIRP
(Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="06french.html#fig-pie">3</A>). The RD can be thought of as a summarization of
the capabilities and content of the resource. It is a surrogate for
the resource in both the traditional sense of providing static
information about content, access, and data types, and in the
non-traditional sense of providing direct dynamic access to the VIRP,
and, thus, the resource itself. A Resource Description carries a live
handle to the VIRP, and so holders of an RD can invoke searches on the
VIRP and collect results from these searches. Resource Descriptions
may come from a variety of places -- for example, our formulation of the
VIRP includes methods for emitting RDs provided security constraints
are met. Thus, an RD can carry information direct from the VIRP.</p>

<P>
To create a Personal Collection, users manipulate Resource
Descriptions. Possession of an RD allows the user direct access to
information about the actual resource. Access to several RDs allows
the construction of a search context highly specific to the
collection. For example, RDs could contain statistical signatures of
document content, allowing the creation of a single statistical
signature for search of that collection of resources where that
signature is based only on those resources in the PeC at search
time. This signature is contained in the Personal Collection, not in
the VIRPs, so addition or removal of RDs requires changes in the PeC,
not in the resources themselves. Of course, this assumes the
willingness of a resource to give up such statistical information to
begin with. Some providers will be willing to give up such
information, others will do so only for a fee. Random sampling of the
resource is an indirect way to determine a resource's statistical
properties [<A
 HREF="06french.html#cal-sigmod99">4</A>].</p>

<P>
In addition to RDs, PeCs will contain significant information related
to user manipulations. Minimally, this would include desktop
organization information and user annotations, but, in the case of
shared PeCs, would also include access control information and
anonymized PeC usage patterns.</p>

Operational Scenarios -- Using a PIE
</H3>
We now turn to describing three operational scenarios that fit within
the PIE framework: Adhoc Search, Information Filtering, and Selective Dissemination of Information.</p>

<P>

<Strong><A NAME="SECTION00041000000000000000">
Ad Hoc Search</a></Strong>
</p>

<p>In this familiar scenario, users pose a one-time query to an
information system hoping to receive information that is relevant to
that query. In the PIE, this activity can occur after PeC building
or in concert with it. The PIE accepts the query from the user
and associates it with the appropriate PeC. The PeC then sends the
query to each resource through the corresponding RD. After remote
execution of the query at each resource, results are sent back to the
PeC for merging and presentation to the user. Accompanying these
results would be query-specific collection statistics that allow the
PeC to do intelligent merging of the results. Alternatively, the PeC
could decouple the maintenance of collection statistics with query
execution, instead undergoing separate interactions through the PVAs
to maintain this information.</p>

<P>

<Strong><A NAME="SECTION00042000000000000000">
Filtering Document Streams</A>
</Strong></p>

<p>Another scenario is one in which a PIE user builds a PeC in order to
execute a continuous or standing query, i.e., to perform information
filtering. Conceptually, filtering involves placing a user profile in
a stream of documents, and sending notifications to the user for those
documents deemed relevant to the profile. In order to do filtering
within the PIE framework, we must assume that the information
resources support queries that can exclude documents that have already
been seen. Date based queries of the form "Give me all documents
since 'date'" would suffice; failing that, some history mechanism
must be maintained.  With this capability, filtering can take
place. User profiles can be kept at either the VIRPs or in the
individual PeCs -- there are clear consequences for each
mechanism. Keeping profiles at the VIRPs means that the comparison and
decision process takes place there, and that the VIRP is responsible
for periodic execution of each standing query. In the presence of
faults, the VIRP might also have to keep track of the last successful
contact for each profile, to ensure that each profile has a chance at
every inserted document. On the other hand, pushing the profile all
the way back to the PeC requires the PeC to keep track of such
information and to periodically execute the standing query
conjunctively with the exclusion predicate mentioned
previously. Effective filtering may be best enabled in this
formulation because the PeC-wide context is available here, but would
probably not be available in the VIRPs. No matter where the initial
filtering takes place, additional filters can be implemented within
the PeC.</p>

<P>

<Strong><A NAME="SECTION00043000000000000000">
Selective Dissemination of Information -- Looking for Users</A>
</Strong></p> 

<P>
In a very real sense, information retrieval and information filtering
are duals -- information retrieval involves users finding documents,
while filtering
involves documents finding users [<A
 HREF="06french.html#bel-cacm92">1</A>, <A
 HREF="06french.html#fre-idt94">6</A>]. We now
consider the PIE framework in a different context, that of a selective
dissemination of information (SDI) provider, so we interpret
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="06french.html#fig-pie">3</A> in a different way. In this context, the PIE "user"
is an information resource who wishes to find user profiles. User
profiles are kept in a profile database, and a VIRP acts as a front-end
to these databases. A PeC is then a collection of user profile
databases. To complete the picture, document insertions represent
queries. These queries are routed to the VIRPs whose profile databases
are members of the PeC. Sets of matching profiles are returned. The
PIE can then process these returns and send notifications along to
users.</p>

<P>
There are, of course, some obvious differences between the two PIE
frameworks. They include the relative sizes of the information
resource (document database versus profile database), the relative
frequency of queries (user queries versus document insertions), and
many others. Instantiations of a PIE architecture would obviously
reflect these differences.
The main observation is that efficient distributed searching
can be used to support retrieval and SDI.</p>

Research Directions and Approaches
</H3>
The PIE vision and architectural description provide a framework
within which a variety of research questions can be addressed. These
questions include (but are certainly not limited to):</p>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>
What kind of methods are appropriate for identifying resources to be added or
removed from the overall resource pallette? To what extent can these
methods be automated?</li></p>
<p><LI>
What specific resource attributes should be made available to the
user from the resource pallette to aid in resource selection? How do
we evaluate the selection process? What are the evaluation criteria?</li></p>
<p><LI>
What are appropriate class hierarchies and base classes that
encapsulate requisite functionality while providing a common interface?</li></p>
<p><LI>
How can PeC defined collection statistics be circulated efficiently?
What is the set of minimal collection statistics needed to support
effective search?</li></p>
<p><LI>
What are effective tools for PeC formulation?</li></p>
<p><LI>
How might composite Resource Descriptions be created? To what extent
can creation of such composites be automated?</li></p>
</UL></p>
<P>
Many of these questions require working testbeds in order to conduct
the research. Accordingly, work must also progress in identifying and
instrumenting appropriate test data and environments.</p>

Approaches
</Strong></p>

<P>
Two research areas for which we have specific approaches and
operational agendas include work related to 1) distributed object
systems and 2) development and evaluation of collection selection
techniques. These are summarized below.</p>

<P>

<Strong><A NAME="SECTION00051100000000000000">
Distributed Objects and Legion</A>
</Strong></p>

<P>
Legion [<A
 HREF="06french.html#grimshaw-cacm97">17</A>] (<a href="http://legion.virginia.edu/">http://legion.virginia.edu/</a>) is a
meta-system project begun at the University of Virginia to address many of the software
problems encountered when building distributed and parallel
applications in a wide area environment. These problems include
scalability, heterogeneity, resource access, security and many
others. Legion provides a solid, object-oriented conceptual base upon
which solutions to the above problems can be built.</p>

<P>
There are three aspects of Legion that are of particular interest to our
work. The first is the presence of a <i>language-based</i>
mechanism and implementation to express communication patterns in
persistent, distributed objects. The second is the ability to express
parallel computation at the language level and support for parallel
execution in the run-time system. Finally, an integrated, flexible
security model and implementation allows the expression of multiple
policies in a relatively straightfoward fashion.</p>

<P>
Through the Mentat Programming Language(MPL) [<A
 HREF="06french.html#mentat-tr94">16</A>]
and its associated compiler,
Legion provides an easy mechanism to support inter-object
communication and parallelism. Through data-flow analysis, the MPL
compiler automatically detects data dependencies between objects and
ensures that these data dependencies are honored even when objects are
physically distributed throughout the Legion system. Objects with no
data dependencies are allowed to compute in parallel and
asynchronously.</p> 

<P>
A general description of the Legion security model is
provided here; more detail is available in Wulf, et al. [<A
 HREF="06french.html#wul-tr95">28</A>].
The Legion system will run in many administrative domains, in
heterogeneous environments, and on top of host operating
systems. Furthermore, Legion applications will have fundamentally
different security requirements, so prescribing a particular level of
security is doomed to failure. The Legion security philosophy is thus
to provide a general mechanism for doing message level security
through encryption and decryption, and for object level security using
an object-provided security function called <i>MayI</i>. The Legion
run-time system guarantees that <i>MayI</i> will be called on every
method invocation on an object. Default <i>MayI's</i> will be
provided, but by allowing objects to provide their own implementation,
security ultimately resides in the object's domain.
Implementations of various security policies are being provided using
this general mechanism.</p>

<P>
The use of the Legion system is a natural mechanism by which to
realize many of our goals. It is a distributed object system designed
to enable distributed computations -- this is a necessary attribute in
any working implementation. Just as important, Legion's <i>MayI</i>
based security model is well-suited for PeC sharing among trusted
parties. The implementation of <i>MayI</i> is configurable on a per object
basis, allowing degrees of security and sharing. For example, a <i>MayI</i>
might appeal to a trusted third party to determine whether the
invoking party is allowed to share the PeC upon which the method has
been invoked. Finally, because Legion's non-blocking, 
dataflow-based
computation model is specifically designed and well suited for
parallel computation, a Legion-based implementation for searching will
automatically benefit through parallel search of document collections.</p>

<P>
From PIE architectural standpoint, VIRPs and PeCs might be Legion Objects
that export an interface that encapsulates the required inter-object
communication patterns. As long as a PeC or PIE has the location
independent name of a VIRP, then the particular location of the VIRP
is immaterial and it can be shared among many PeCs and PIEs.</p>

<P>
We are in the process of implementing the PIE architecture using
Legion as infrastructure and data from the Networked Computer Science
Technical Reference Library
(<a href="http://www.ncstrl.org/">http://www.ncstrl.org/</a>).
The current implementation supports interactive creation of Personal
Collections using simple and composite Resource Descriptions. The VIRP
implementation speaks NCSTRL's native access protocol, Dienst, and
does significant caching of data in order to speed search. Both VIRPs
and PeCs are Legion objects -- thus they are persistent, relocatable, and 
can support sharing and controlled access.</p> 

<P>

<Strong><A NAME="SECTION00051200000000000000">
Collection Selection</A>
</Strong></p>
<p>The process of choosing which information resources should be
consulted when a query has been posed has been called text database
discovery [<A
 HREF="06french.html#gra-tods99">14</A>], collection selection [<A
 HREF="06french.html#cal-sigir95">5</A>],
and database selection [<A
 HREF="06french.html#fre-sigir98">9</A>]. In the PIE, selection
happens at two levels. When users create a personal collection, they
explicitly include and exclude information collections as they
manipulate resource descriptions, so at this level they are performing
selection. This process may still yield a large number of remaining
resources -- so many that simple broadcast of queries to all resources
in the remaining collection might be ill-advised from a network
utilization standpoint. The problem at this level then becomes
determining which of the remaining resources should be consulted and
in what order. This second level is the one that has received
attention in the literature, with the assumption that the
resource/collection/database with the most "good" or "relevant"
material should be consulted first.</p>

<P>
Our work on the selection problem has concentrated thus far on the
second level, where the assumption is that some potentially large set
of resources has been identified as likely to contain relevant information. One
of the problems with early efforts on the selection problem was the
lack of agreement on evaluation metrics and test environments, making
direct comparison of techniques essentially impossible. We have spent
a good deal of effort developing common testbeds within which various
selection algorithms might be compared fairly and unambiguously
[<A
 HREF="06french.html#fre-sigir98">9</A>]. One point of disagreement in the literature is on
what the appropriate "best" or "ideal" method would
yield. Regardless of the "ideal" method, our follow-on work
indicates that there is still significant improvement possible and
desirable [<A
 HREF="06french.html#fre-tr99">7</A>].</p>

<P>
We have also been considering domain specific methods to further prune
the search space once a personal collection has been
developed [<A
 HREF="06french.html#fre-dl98">8</A>]. For example, many of the searches on the
NCSTRL collection are author restricted. Thus if an NCSTRL site
exports its author list in a Resource Description, a PeC holding that
RD could easily determine whether sending an author-restricted query
to that site would be fruitful by simply checking the author list in
the RD. This capability has been implemented in the prototype NCSTRL
PIE.</p>

<P>
The PIE is both a vision of user-centric, customizable access to
distributed information and a framework for research. In this section,
we take a narrower view and focus on work most related to our
current research agenda, recognizing that there are large bodies of
work (in, e.g., human/computer interaction, information organization)
that are highly related to the larger vision of the PIE, but which are not immediately related to our current research agenda.</p>

<P>
Existing Web-based search engines like Infoseek
(<a href="http://www.infoseek.com/">http://www.infoseek.com/</a>) and Excite (<a href="http://www.excite.com/">http://www.excite.com/</a>) build
centralized, static databases. They offer pre-computed sub-indexes
devoted to various popular subjects. Some of these services
(www.yahoo.com) allow personalized views of their indexes
through registration of a user-profile. Control of the specific data
sources from which these indexes are built is generally not
possible. We envision a system with greater user control over which
individual data streams are examined and their relative
importance.</p>

<P>
The Harvest project provided tools to gather, extract, index, and organize distributed information. The main focus was on efficiency, not effectiveness. Harvest was not designed for, and does not support, the kind of personalized, dynamic configurability that we propose.</p>

<P>
The information retrieval community has begun to look at problems
associated with merging results from searches on separate document
collections, the problem
[<A
 HREF="06french.html#voo-trec5">26</A>, <A
 HREF="06french.html#voo-sigir95">27</A>, <A
 HREF="06french.html#cal-sigir95">5</A>]. Some approaches rely on prior
knowledge of a searcher's interest in a particular collection while
others rely on complete knowledge of collection statistics. Both
approaches have merit.</p>

<P>
As we have noted previously, collection selection has been examined in
both the information retrieval community
[<A
 HREF="06french.html#cal-sigir95">5</A>, <A
 HREF="06french.html#voo-sigir95">27</A>, <A
 HREF="06french.html#fre-sigir98">9</A>] and in the database
community [<A
 HREF="06french.html#gra-sigmod94">15</A>, <A
 HREF="06french.html#gra-tods99">14</A>], with information retrieval
originated research concentrating on effectiveness issues and DB
originated research looking at efficiency. We view collection
selection as at least a two-phase process. In the first phase, the
user actively participates in the choice of resources to include, with the system providing descriptive information to help in the process. In the second phase, the system provides more explicit guidance about what resources should be contacted and in what order.</p>

<P>
Our own work [<A
 HREF="06french.html#vil-sigir95">24</A>, <A
 HREF="06french.html#vil-diss">23</A>, <A
 HREF="06french.html#vil-cikm95">25</A>, <A
 HREF="06french.html#fre-jvcir96">10</A>]
and recent work by Callan [<A
 HREF="06french.html#cal-sigir96">3</A>]
suggest that the use of collection statistics derived from a
portion of a document collection is sufficient to give good retrieval
effectiveness in both search and filtering environments.</p> 

<P>
We will build
on these findings to explore the best mechanism to communicate
collection statistics in the the highly configurable personalized
environment we envision.</p>

<P>
The use of distributed object technology is not new.  The Stanford
Digital Library Project uses
CORBA [<A
 HREF="06french.html#pae-computer96">21</A>, <A
 HREF="06french.html#pae-computer99">20</A>]. In addition to our familiarity with 
Legion [<A
 HREF="06french.html#grimshaw-cacm97">17</A>], our choice of this system is based upon our needs for 1) persistent objects; 2) flexible and configurable security and access control policies; and 3) high performance computation for simulations and some PIE algorithms.</p>

<P>
The work of Schatz [<A
 HREF="06french.html#sch-cacm95">22</A>] and others at the Illinois Digital
Library Initiative is highly relevant to the PIE. Schatz's
Interspace describes a world of connected information units where each
unit is highly tuned to a particular community or set of individuals.
The community is responsible for the maintenance and evolution of the
unit. Shared PeCs fit very well into this vision.</p> 

<P>
The STARTS initiative out of the Stanford Digital Library project was an
effort to design a standard protocol by which information resources
provide meta-data about their holdings. An important part of the
proposed protocol, from our perspective, is the inclusion
of a mechanism for returning statistical information about
the information resource along with query
results [<A
 HREF="06french.html#gravano-sigmod97">12</A>].</p>

<P>
The IRISWeb project [<A
 HREF="06french.html#sum-dl98">18</A>] and some commercial software
(e.g., Ultraseek Server) take a significant step towards providing a
user-specified collection of resources. These systems allow a user to
provide a web page of seed URLs and a crawl distance from that
page. These URLs and the crawl distance define a <i>virtual
collection</i> that is the connected graph composed of the original URLs
and all pages <I>N</I> links away or less. Harvesting software then
downloads and indexes these pages and provides a relevance-feedback
based search interface to the collection.</p>

<P>
We have defined a user-centric vision of access to information called
the Personalized Information Environment or PIE. The key concepts in
the PIE include 1) customizability; 2) effective, efficient search; 3)
controlled sharability; and 4) privacy and security.</p>

<P>
Our architecture for the PIE includes Virtual Repositories to act as
front-ends to arbitrary information resources, Resource Descriptions
to act as surrogates or summaries of the contents of information
resources, and Personal Collections of user-created and maintained
collections of related resources.</p>
