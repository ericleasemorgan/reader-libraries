<p>
The International Conference of Asian Digital Libraries (ICADL) series has grown into a grand annual event for the library and IT communities in Asia and the rest of the world as well. After ICADL's six years of continuous effort to serve as a forum for exchanging, promoting and sharing the latest development of digital libraries in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Seoul, Bangalore, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur, this 7<sup>th</sup> ICADL conference was a major success. The quality of submitted papers and diversity in participation, geographically and professionally, has made ICADL an important international conference. At the end of ICADL 2004, all participants I personally observed departed with big smiles.
</p>

<p>
ICADL 2004 was held in Shanghai, China, and was organized by Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Shanghai Library. The organizers benefited from the support of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Vice-Mayor Junqi Yan, and President Shenwu Xie of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, who served as Chair of the Steering Committee. The Shanghai Society for Library Science and the Committee for Academic Libraries of Shanghai served as co-organizers of the conference.
</p>


<p>
The theme of ICADL 2004 was "Digital library: International Collaboration and Cross-Fertilization", and its focus was on technology, service, management and localization. 
</p>

<p>
The conference featured 6 tutorials, 7 keynote speeches, 7 invited talks, and 66 full and short paper presentations in 21 sessions. Sponsors of ICADL 2004 included 37 companies, such as Springer, ISI, HP, CNPIEC, etc. Among them, 20 sponsors manned booths at the conference exhibition, which was held simultaneously with the conference. There were 311 participants at ICADL 2004, among whom 177 came from China and 134 from 26 other countries. Some 200 people attended the 6 preconference tutorials. 
</p>

<p>
The ICADL 2004 Program Committee adopted an electronic paper submission and review system (i.e., ACM ConfMan) for transparency and efficiency. The Committee consisted of 84 members from Asia, the USA and Europe and was led by Co-Chairs from those 3 regions. ICADL 2004 received a total of 248 full paper and 111 short paper submissions from 967 authors. Of the 248 full papers, 44 were accepted as full papers and 28 as poster papers. Of the 111 short papers, 15 were accepted as short papers and 9 as poster papers. The full paper acceptance rate is 44/248 = 17.7%.  The overall acceptance rate among the full paper submissions is 72/248 = 29.0%.  The short paper acceptance rate is 15/111= 13.5%.  The overall acceptance rate among the short paper submissions is 24/111= 21.6%. A total of 96 papers were accepted for the 690-page conference proceedings. 
</p>

<p>
In addition to the submitted, reviewed and accepted papers, the conference featured 7 papers by keynote speakers and 7 papers by invited speakers. Keynote and invited speakers came from the USA, New Zealand, Germany, Canada and China. 
</p>

<p>
Conference registration began on December 13. The preconference tutorials were held the next day. The first two tutorials the morning of December 14 were:  "Knowledge Management Systems: Development and Applications" by Hsinchun Chen, University of Arizona, USA, and "Digital Library: Overview and Framework" by Edward Fox, Virginia Tech, USA. In the afternoon, the first two tutorials were: "Metadata in Digital Libraries" by Xiaolin Zhang, Library of Chinese Academy of Science, China, and "Digital Enterprises and E-Commerce Systems" by Su-Shing Chen, University of Florida-Gainesville, USA. Next were: "Context-enhanced Digital Library Services" by Erich Neuhold, Darmstadt University of Technology, Germany, and "Building Digital Libraries Using Open Source Software" by Ian Witten, University of Waikato, New Zealand.
