<H3><FONT color=#000066>Abstract</FONT></H3>  

<FONT color=#000066>Library users who are Web users expect customization and interactivity. MyLibrary is a Cornell
University Library initiative to provide numerous personalized library services to Cornell University
students, faculty, and staff. Currently, it consists of MyLinks, a tool for collecting and organizing
resources for private use by a patron, and MyUpdates, a tool to help scholars stay informed of new
resources provided by the library. This article provides an overview of the MyLibrary project,
explains the rationale for the development of the service in the library, briefly discusses the hardware
and software used for the service, and suggests some of the directions for future developments of
the MyLibrary system.</font></P>

<H3>What is MyLibrary?
</H3>

<P>MyYahoo!, MyCNN, MyBookmarks, MyThis and MyThat. Internet users have demanded a
personal face to the World Wide Web, and Web portals and information providers have responded.
Why not MyLibrary? The Library and Information Technology Association (LITA) has defined
MyLibrary-like services as the number one trend "worth keeping an eye on"[<a href="04mistlebauer.html#1">1</a>]. "Library users who are Web
users, a growing group," the experts agree, "expect customization, interactivity, and customer
support. Approaches that are library-focused instead of user-focused will be increasingly irrelevant."</P>

<p>In response to the needs of web-savvy patrons, the Cornell University Library (CUL) implemented
a MyLibrary service this year, making finding and using library resources easier than ever.
MyLibrary [<a href="04mistlebauer.html#2">2</a>] is an "umbrella" service for two new products: MyLinks and MyUpdates. Other
products are in development.</p>

<p align="center"><Img src="MyLibrary1.gif" width="500" height="464" alt="Screenshot for MyLibrary at Cornell University"><br><br>
<strong><font size=-1>My Library at Cornell University</font></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>MyLibrary’s MyLinks is a tool for collecting and organizing resources for private use by a patron.
These resources may or may not be "official" Cornell University Library resources. Our patrons best
understand this service as a "traveling set of bookmarks". Most patrons of the library use a variety
of machines to access Internet resources. For example, you may have a computer at home and one
at work. Why should you create your bookmarks twice, or carry around a diskette containing your
bookmarks? Students who rely on lab computers never know which machine they will use next.
With MyLinks, a patron’s favorite sites are just a click away from any machine. </p>


<p align="center"><Img src="MyLinks3.gif" width="500" height="449" alt="Partial View of MyLinks Screen"><br><br>
<strong><font size=-1>Partial View of MyLinks Screen</font></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>MyLibrary’s MyUpdates helps scholars stay informed of new resources provided by the library. In
the past, Cornell University, with its 19 major library units, has addressed this problem by creating
accession lists for individual departments. But such lists are cumbersome for library staff to produce,
and they can only serve a small number of patrons.</p>

<p>By contrast, MyUpdates periodically queries the on-line catalog to determine which resources are
new. If the new resources match the pre-identified needs of a patron, the system notifies the patron.
Patrons no longer need to search the on-line catalog regularly to be aware of new resources.
MyUpdates searches the on-line catalog for patrons and e-mails the results to them automatically.</p>

<p>The current release of MyLibrary is just the first step towards offering numerous personalized
services to Cornell University students, faculty, and staff. The library has invested a lot of time and
resources into making MyLibrary a reality. Why is the library doing this when there are commercial
sites providing similar services?</p>

<H3>Why not use a commercially available site?</H3>

<P>What distinguishes commercial, personalized online services from MyLibrary is their inability to meet
the research needs of their users. MyYahoo! is not a library-centric service, nor is it likely ever to
become one. It caters to the casual Web user’s needs for general information, such as the day’s
headlines and local weather, but is unable to feed a user’s knowledge-seeking desires. Moreover, it
does so without finesse. It is quite simple to find the closing stock price for Amazon.com and add
that figure to a web page. It is far more difficult to suggest to a user quality reference sources that
discuss the reasons behind Amazon’s rise to the apex of online specialty retailing. MyLibrary has the
potential to be an academic’s primary knowledge-based web space as he or she follows a research
path (or, indeed, simultaneous research paths) for many months or even several years. The
proposed enhancements discussed elsewhere in this paper detail many of the research-oriented
"add-ins" we believe will cause library patrons to rely on MyLibrary as a primary research tool.  </P>





<H3>Why did Cornell develop MyLibrary? </H3>

<P>The acute need for a MyLibrary model at Cornell was recognized after patrons requested solutions
for information excess. Just as the number of pages on the World Wide Web is ever increasing, so
too is the range of resources in the 19 Cornell libraries; we became concerned with the possibility
that the scholars in our community were becoming lost in a plethora of information. </P>

<P>In 1998, Cornell librarians Karen Calhoun and Zsuzsa Koltay  conducted a focus group study to
gauge library patron use of and satisfaction with the Cornell University Library Gateway [<a href="04mistlebauer.html#3">3</a>]. The Library Gateway [<a href="04mistlebauer.html#4">4</a>] is Cornell University Library’s Web presence. The Gateway
offers an array of information and online services, including a selection of 2,000 networked
resources.</P>

<p>Calhoun and Koltay found that users consider the Gateway occasionally "overwhelming" and
desired "a more personal space…where they can dictate how important certain resources are based
on their own needs" [<a href="04mistlebauer.html#5">5</a>]. Additionally, they noted, "Users want to be in
closer communication with the library. They feel that the library provides great services for those
who happen to find out about them and teach themselves how to use them." Among their post-study
recommendations were the following suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li>"Explore new ways and technologies to simplify the task of navigating a complex information
     scene"; </li>
<li>"Provide personalized and current awareness services"; </li>
<li>"Add new features to the Gateway such as "What’s New", hot topics, favorite databases,
     and subject guides."</li>
</ol>

<p>The study’s findings prompted the Cornell University Library to devise a technological tool that
would simultaneously fulfill as many of the above recommendations as possible. In so doing,
MyLibrary has developed into a hybrid of the commercial personal portal and Cornell’s own
Gateway.</p>

<p>Implementing MyLibrary also furthers CUL’s goal to "provide outstanding service to the university
in support of Cornell’s information needs by integrating traditional and digital resources and
services" [<a href="04mistlebauer.html#6">6</a>]. The traditional services that librarians
have always provided include the selection, organization, and provision of enhanced access to useful
information. In the past, libraries owned all of the resources in their collections, and patrons would
need to physically visit the library to use its materials. Today, however, libraries are competing with
other information sources (such as the Internet), and they are also making their own collections
available to the public using digital technologies. Now patrons may be predominantly virtual users of
resources, and as a result, many public service discussions revolve around how to ensure that
patrons will continue to patronize physical libraries. MyLibrary is one strategic way to keep people
coming to the library by providing a service that supports Cornell’s information needs. The
MyLibrary model accepts the reality that people are finding information on the Internet and provides
a way to integrate these "other" resources with the Library resources that have been evaluated and
selected by librarians. Proposed MyLibrary enhancements will encourage use of the physical
Cornell Library collection (via MyUpdates, for example) while also providing easier access to our
digital holdings.</p>

<p>Current library literature and presentations at library conferences discuss how librarians can better
market themselves to convey the valuable services that they provide. MyLibrary "allows for
incredibly detailed targeted marketing of [the] library’s staff, services and resources based on such
factors as patron’s unique interests, the types of sources they use most, their academic major, or
any other factor that seems relevant" [<a href="04mistlebauer.html#7">7</a>]. The librarian can learn of a patron’s interests and then forward to
him/her suggested targeted resources, thereby launching the library into the world of "push"
technology. We need to be proactive rather than reactive if we do not want to lose our patrons to
commercial competitors.</p>

<p>
Traditionally, if librarians know of student or faculty research interests, they attempt to keep those
researchers informed of potentially useful sources. Due to the size of Cornell’s research population,
it is not possible to know everyone’s research topics. MyLibrary automates this function and allows
the user to initiate the updating process. Researchers can save useful resources in MyLinks
(resources that they have discovered themselves or ones suggested by librarians via targeted
notification) and be automatically notified by MyUpdates of new resources related to their saved
search topics. Researchers who travel can access their saved resources wherever
they are.</p>

<p>As we create our own digital library products and purchase more commercially available digital
information, our patrons become more overwhelmed by their options. It is difficult to organize
resources into categories that are intuitive for every patron, especially when our patrons include
undergraduate students, graduate students, staff and faculty, all of whom are studying hundreds of
different subjects. Cornell University Library’s "Library Gateway" attempts to be a structured web
conduit, but MyLibrary gives the user a way to create their own user interfaces, ones which make
especial sense to them. They can create these interfaces without even having to know how to make
their own web pages.</p>

<p>Beyond the theory of MyLibrary as an excellent information tool lies its human reality: the creation,
implementation, and enhancement of MyLibrary requires a serious commitment of staff time.
Without an increase in the number of staff, the MyLibrary system must take library personnel away
from other duties or projects. It is hoped that the time and effort put into MyLibrary will pay off in
more information-literate users who are more aware of the resources that could be useful to them.
Additionally, public services staff will be able to track user perception of the usefulness of library
and other electronic resources. For example, which database or web site has a patron chosen to put
into a MyLinks folder? It might also be valuable to monitor if a subject librarian’s recommendation
to patrons (via the MyLibrary Announcement Service described below) results in additions to their
MyLinks. This information can then be analyzed according to discipline and patron group, providing
vital statistics which previously we have not been able to gather easily. Imagine if every student,
staff, and faculty member made visits to their MyLibrary pages a part of their daily routine and we
were tracking that activity? The library system in general, and public services in particular, can only
benefit from increased patron use of MyLibrary.</p>

<H3>How was MyLibrary developed?</H3>

<P>The MyLibrary system was developed by the Personal Electronic Services Working Group, a
collection of Cornell University librarians and programmers. The members of this working group
represented seven of the libraries on campus. This mix of players helped ensure that we developed
a product useful to all students, faculty, and staff. The initial charge to the team was to determine
which personal services Cornell users needed. We quickly identified the need for a personal set of
"shortcuts" to resources (to be called MyLinks) and for notification when items of interest are added
to the on-line catalog (to be called MyUpdates). MyLinks and MyUpdates, which share a
developmental approach and core technologies, in fact are individual systems unto themselves. In
combination, these two products form the current MyLibrary service. The next MyLibrary release
will contain additional services. </P>

<P>During the course of the development of MyLibrary, there were several decisions made regarding its
implementation and the choice of technologies used. Two of these decisions were to use a formal
design process and have the development team adopt certain standards for a web-based
application with a database back end.   </P>

<P>The Rational Unified Process (RUP) was the project methodology employed. This object-oriented
process provided a strong justification to employ an object-oriented language for the development
of MyLibrary. As a result, Java programs dynamically create the HTML seen by the patrons on
almost all of the MyLibrary pages. Specifically, the design team chose to use Java servlets for
implementing access to the database and providing dynamic web content. This choice allowed
the use of the JDBC standard for querying, inserting, and modifying records in the database, as well
as the use of some pre-written packages for displaying dynamic content. </P>

<p>Oracle is the database technology used for storing information about users of the MyLibrary system.
It is a robust database with the capacity to handle the large number of transactions and vast amount
of data an application such as MyLibrary might generate.</p>

<p>One of the most important aspects of the MyLibrary system is the authentication of its users. The
authentication system ensures that the information users choose to put into the system remains private.
The Kerberos Authentication mechanism provides user id and password authentication. Once Kerberos authenticates the user, we use the user's Cornell Network ID to show only the folders
and resources associated with that ID. The system associates dynamic database content with the
user’s Web browser through the use of the Java servlet sessions mechanism created when the user
logs into MyLibrary. When a user is finished using MyLibrary, they merely need to click on a
"Logout" link to close the session and prevent subsequent users on the same computer from viewing
their personal information.</p>

<p>MyLinks, in both appearance and use, is a very intuitive, user-friendly product. The basic premise of
the simple to understand design is that a patron has folders containing links to personally chosen
Web sites. Patrons are able to name the resources and folders whatever they choose, order
the folders in the manner most useful to them, add new resources or remove old ones from folders,
and edit resources if the URLs change. Patrons have the option of selecting from either the
librarian-gathered resources in the Gateway or from any Web resource. When patrons enter MyLinks
for the first time, they will find two default folders already set up for them. One folder contains links
to library services, and the other contains a wide variety of links to Web search engines. The default
folders serve as examples to assist patrons in understanding the concept of MyLinks. </p>


<p>The development of MyUpdates was vastly different from the development of MyLinks.
MyUpdates allows patrons to identify their areas of interest; the system then notifies the patrons
when resources matching those interests are added to the catalog. The concept sounds simple, but
the implementation was not. </p>

<p>The first step was to determine how the data would be accessed from NOTIS, the on-line catalog
used at Cornell. NOTIS is a mainframe-based system ill suited for the kind of user interaction and
search processing that MyUpdates requires. In addition to the technical limitations of NOTIS, the
acquisition and cataloguing workflow at Cornell made it difficult to know when a bibliographic
record in NOTIS should be considered "new." When a resource is first acquired, a corresponding
record in NOTIS is created. Because we want knowledge about the future availability of the
resource to be available to the public as quickly as possible, the acquisition record in NOTIS is
made available to the public while the item is being catalogued. Widespread notification via
MyUpdates of a new resource that was not yet fully catalogued and accessible would, however, be
undesirable.</p>

<p>To begin to solve this dilemma, we made the decision to create a local database to temporarily store
NOTIS bibliographic and holdings data for new materials. As with MyLinks, we selected Oracle
for this purpose. Oracle can support large amounts of information and large numbers of users, and
offers powerful techniques for searching through the information it stores. All of these features would
be necessary for MyUpdates to succeed.</p>

<p>A cataloguer on the project team worked closely with one of our NOTIS system administrators to
create specifications that would help determine which NOTIS records should be considered "new."
Multiple criteria were identified to test against each record to determine their readiness for inclusion
in MyUpdates, and although these criteria were not fool-proof, tests indicated that most of the
records that met the criteria were in fact new; few resources that should be included were being
overlooked by the process. </p>

<p>Once this process was complete, the two team members then created specifications for retrieving a
subset of bibliographic and holdings information from each NOTIS record while preserving the
diacritics each record contained. This information is then stored in our database. </p>

<p>A Web interface allows patrons to create multiple search profiles. Their profiles are stored in the
MyUpdates database and are used to search periodically against the database of new records extracted
from NOTIS. The Web interface resembles an OCLC-style Boolean keyword-searchable
interface. But a concern immediately arose: because Cornell’s libraries serve many diverse
disciplines, how could we provide a method of narrowing these keyword searches by subject area
so that the results of each search would be more relevant? </p>

<p>The MyLibrary team decided that, particularly for the first release of MyUpdates, using a system
like the Library of Congress Subject Headings -- or even an abbreviated version of such a system -- to
define subjects would be too difficult to implement. Instead, as a way to roughly limit searches by
subject, we chose to add the ability for patrons to limit their searches to materials held at one or
more libraries at Cornell which themselves each have a special topical focus.</p>

<p>Finally, before patrons save their search profiles, they can test their searches against the previous
year’s worth of new resources extracted from NOTIS. The resources that meet their criteria are
displayed in the browser. Patrons can then judge by both the number and appropriateness of the
resources retrieved, just how broad or narrow, and also how relevant, are their search profiles. The
system calculates an average of the number of resources patrons are likely to receive each time they
receive notification of the availability of new resources. By basing this calculation on an entire year of new materials data, we can more accurately reflect yearly acquisition trends and the effect of
fiscal cycles on purchasing.</p>

<p>Once a patron is satisfied with a particular search profile, he or she saves the profile (though it can
be edited again at any time). The MyUpdates system automatically runs all patrons’ search profiles
against the most recently-extracted NOTIS records every two weeks. The system then e-mails to
each patron a report of the new records that meet the criteria in his or her saved profile.</p>

<p>By automatically e-mailing the MyUpdates reports, we provide a very simple way to approximate
the goals of "push technology." Push technology fell from favor because traditional push techniques
involved installing a client on an individual machine that waited for information. Often, people
received much more information than they expected, and rather than try to limit what they received,
people simply stopped using these services.</p> 

<p>We recognized that MyUpdates could suffer a similar fate if we did not carefully consider our
patrons’ needs. By managing search profiles through a Web interface, we hope to avoid the need to
install specialized client software on the patron’s machine.</p>

<p>In addition, the Web interface allows patrons to test their search profiles and get a sense of how
much information they will receive before they commit to receiving a particular report. Further,
patrons can edit and re-test the searches at any time. Taken together, these features may help
avoid the previous problems with push technologies of information overload.</p>

<p>Finally, the delivery of reports by e-mail means that patrons receive the reports via software they
already use and are familiar with on their computers. Receiving the reports should not be intrusive.
For those without e-mail, or for those who are away from the workstation where their e-mail is
downloaded, the most recent reports generated for each search profile the patron has created can
be viewed through the MyUpdates Web interface. There is also a link to MyUpdates from within
the Library Services folder of MyLinks, making the service we call MyLibrary truly integrated.</p>

<H3>What is next for MyLibrary?</H3>

<P>MyLibrary was conceived not merely as a clever utility, or even a smorgasbord of utilities, but as a
vehicle for increased interaction with library users in an otherwise depersonalized digital
environment. Future enhancements will expand the interactive characteristics of MyLinks and
MyUpdates in several directions.</p> 

<p>One certain direction is toward building an area for delivering library-related messages within the
user's personal space. A message space or personalized bulletin board could be an extremely
effective way of communicating with patrons. The personalized message would avoid common
pitfalls of library-patron communications, in particular such just-in-case and dubiously effective
methods as mass-mailings and broadcast e-mails on the one hand, and passive media such as web
pages on the other. In the MyLibrary model, patrons would choose the kind of message from the
library they would want to see and would choose the delivery mechanism. For example, a patron could choose to
be reminded of library workshops or instructional programs at a particular point in the semester.
They might want to know when important new bibliographic databases are added to the Gateway,
or when new web sites relevant to their areas of interest appear. Cross-disciplinary researchers might wish to receive notices from different subject specialty libraries.</p>

<p>With careful management, the library should be able to push information to patrons within
parameters the patrons themselves have chosen. Patrons will be able to choose whether to receive
messages through e-mail or to be notified when they log into MyLibrary that they have messages
waiting on their personal page. Such a page might also prove a useful alternative to delivering
MyUpdates reports via e-mail.</p> 

<p>At the same time, a MyLibrary message page should provide patrons with easier methods of access
to librarians and library services. Since the patron’s area of interest has been profiled, the patron
can have e-mail links directly from his or her MyLibrary page to relevant subject specialists in the
library. Possibly a link from a page like this will prove the vehicle that finally moves "chat reference"
off the starting block.</p> 

<p>MyLibrary can make services available to patrons with less fuss. We imagine calling up interlibrary
loan forms, renewal requests, requests for purchase and other forms from MyLibrary with personal
information already filled in. Since patrons are authenticated when they log into MyLibrary, it should
also be possible to pass ids and passwords into these standard forms from a stored profile.</p>

<p>Another interesting direction for MyLibrary to develop is as the basis for providing customized
services for groups as well as persons. One possible implementation is to customize services for
academic departments. In this model, reference librarians and bibliographers can work together with
department representatives to select appropriate collections of links and update profiles for broader
academic subject areas. Again, paralleling the personal model, the library can push information to
this broader group, while the department has access to clearly identified and easily accessible library
specialists through e-mail or chat.</p>

<p>MyLibrary and similar personalized services will provide new ways for libraries to interact with their
various patron bases. They can empower individual patrons with a strong suite of utilities and
tailored communications. The same service forms a convenient way to embrace user groups such as
alumni who otherwise have difficulty identifying and using their alma mater's digital resources.
Departments and other academic groupings gain similar benefits, while the library assumes a higher
profile in a web-flattening information environment. The MyLibrary concept is simple, but powerful:
personalization of services is the key to institutional engagement for the digital library. </P>
