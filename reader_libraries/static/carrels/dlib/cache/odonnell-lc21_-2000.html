<p>It is the Library of Congress's fate to be a symbol as well as a library.
It shares with the ancient library of Alexandria the curse of standing
for
an ill-conceived acme of library perfection -- total comprehensiveness. 
But if Borges's Funes the Memorious discovered that to remember
<i>everything</i> will drive a person mad, so a library knows that to
collect everything is madness as well.  The Library of Congress (LC) has never
succumbed to that madness.  Instead, its inspired leaders for two
centuries have built a working collection that dwarfs all others in size
but remains selective, rich, and accessible.  That is no small
achievement.</p> 

<p>But LC builds its comprehensive collections for an equally comprehensive
audience:  the Congress and the people of the United States.  We pride
ourselves on the free access to information of our public libraries, for
example, but it remains an intriguing fact that the freedom of access to
information that we value in our libraries is always linked to membership
in a community.  To use a library's full resources, we typically have to
live in the right town or be part of the right university.  That
limitation in traditional librarianship means that librarians have the
great benefit of being able to hear from their customers, the satisfied
ones and the angry ones.  Customers give librarians focus and help them
make the inevitable choices among desirable goals, help them focus their
collections and services.</p>

<p>LC thus looks for direction not chiefly to its customers but to a 'board
of directors' with 535 members -- the House and Senate.  But LC is
scarcely
their first priority, nor should it be.  Furthermore, Representatives and
Senators  get their own needs attended to by a branch of LC, the
Congressional Research Service, which is something between a tenured
faculty and the most amazingly skilled reference staff in history.
Members of Congress will thus have at best imperfect knowledge of the
body
they are obliged to guide.</p>

<p>For many years, it was possible for LC to evolve peacefully in such an
environment.  But the onslaught of digital information and the excitement
surrounding it are destabilizing for any library.  Without a clearly-defined client base to serve and satisfy, LC is at a disadvantage.  Even
so, it has responded in several ways, notably with the "National Digital
Library Program" -- misleadingly named but worthy, an effort, now
successful, to digitize 5,000,000 documents  from the library's
collections.  With that program came some shift of emphasis within the
traditional mission and audience.  For the first time, LC now explicitly
addresses "kids and families" with &lt;<a href="http://www.americaslibrary.gov">http://www.americaslibrary.gov</a>&gt;,
offering to help readers "meet amazing Americans" (legend next to an
image
of George Armstrong Custer), among other things.  On other fronts, the
Law
Library is working to build a database of world legal materials, and the
Copyright Office has struggled to devise a system for receiving deposit
and registering copyright for digital materials.</p>

<p>But the whole still adds up to something less than the sum of its parts,
and there has been no clear digital vision for the organization as a
whole.  To his great credit, the Librarian of Congress, Dr. James H.
Billington, recognized the anomie and sought expert counsel.  In 1998, he
initiated and funded an eighteen-month study of LC and its response to
the
information technology revolution to be conducted by the National Academy
of Sciences through the National Research Council (to be specific,
through
NRC's <a href="http://www.cstb.org">Computer Science and Telecommunications Board</a>).  I was asked to
chair the committee and worked with NRC to build a <a
href=http://books.nap.edu/books/0309071445/html/R5.html#pagetop>panel of
another 15 experts (librarians, computer scientists, media specialists,
etc.) from around the country</a>, including several members of the
National Academies themselves (a <a
href="http://books.nap.edu/books/0309071445/html/182.html#pagetop">fuller
listing with biographies also available</a>).  The committee visited LC
many times, consulted broadly within and without the organization, and
had
the benefit as well of NRC's standard blind peer review process, by which
findings were submitted to 24 experts and the committee was then obliged
to respond to their comments and criticisms.</p>  

<p>This work is now complete.  The report was released in near-published
form
on the web in July and will appear in print form for sale through
National
Academy Press later this year as <i>LC21:  A Digital Strategy for the
Library of Congress</i>.  Given the interest of the material and its
ready
availability on the web, I will not rehearse the report in detail here,
but will rather try first to touch on a few of the high points and then
to
offer a guide to its resources.  The process has been vastly educational
and an intellectual pleasure for all those of us who worked on it.  We
are
left with a sense of the exciting importance of the issues and
possibilities, and with caution and concern whether LC will be able to
respond successfully.</p> 

<p>The chief finding in substance is that LC has not yet begun to grapple
successfully with its responsibility to select, acquire, and preserve
materials that are "born digital" -- that is, that first come to being in
electronic form.  "Born digital material" includes CD-ROM publication and
the like, but is dominated by web-based material, both the
commercially-published material and the waterfall of web material that is
not thought of in terms of conventional publication but that is, much of
it, of high value as "a universal collection of knowledge and creativity
for future generations" (as the Library's mission statement puts it). 
Successful response by LC to the challenge of "born digital" material
would include creating a seamless system that allows it to enforce the
mandatory deposit provisions of US law by acquiring, selecting,
cataloging, and making accessible material in electronic form.  The
difficulties of the task are immense, and LC at this point has done no
more than nibble at the edges with small pilot programs.  The report
urges
a major effort.  It is an effort that can only succeed if it is made not
by LC alone, but by LC in collaboration with publishers, libraries, and
technologists around the country and around the world. </p>

<p>The chief subordinate finding is that there are management issues within
LC that have conspired to make it hard to react in a timely and effective
way.  These range from misalignment of priorities in IT budgeting to
extraordinary difficulties in human resources areas (not just in paying
technical staff but in dealing with the legacy of a lawsuit filed by its
own employees that has left the Library constrained by the terms of a
consent decree aimed at uprooting past inequities) to limited vision and
expertise at the top of the organization.  LC is not one organization but
a collection of organizations, often working independently.  What it
needs
now at the center is synthetic vision and authority that can bring units
together to work effectively to create a new kind of library. 
Accordingly, the report recommends appointment of a new Deputy Librarian
for Strategic Initiatives.</p>

<p>At this writing, LC has welcomed the report and declared firmly its
intention to respond positively and effectively.  Among the procedural
recommendations are suggested new bodies to facilitate vision: 
internally, an IT Vision, Strategy, Research and Planning Group, and
externally, a Technical Advisory Board serving pro bono to keep the
Library on its toes. The members of the committee look forward to
following
developments closely in the months to come.</p>

issues</a> (perhaps the most acute technical challenges facing digital
librarianship), <a
