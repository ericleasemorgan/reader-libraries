   <!-- Story goes next -->   
 <p>For five years, the Asian Digital Libraries conference series has
 provided a forum for 'local' digital libraries researchers to network,
 exchange ideas, and present research results.  The 2002 conference
 continued the previous emphasis on problems specific to digital
 library development in the Asia-Pacific area, while at the same
 time attracting a broad international audience.  This year's 
conference was held in conjunction with the Web Information Systems
 Engineering (WISE) conference, which focuses on Web-related
 database technology. The two conferences shared joint keynote
 addresses from Serge Abiteboul (INRIA, speaking on 'Web Services
 and Web Integration')  and Srikant Ramakrishnan (IBM Almaden
 Research Lab, speaking on 'Data Mining Technologies for
 Digital Libraries and Web Information Systems').</p>

<p>The ICADL programme included an additional keynote
 address by Jane Prey (NSF, describing NSF activities
 related to educational digital libraries), 4 tutorials,
 6 invited talks, 34 'long' paper presentations, 20 'short'
 paper talks, and 16 poster papers.  Four tutorials were
 offered:  Evaluating Digital Libraries for Usability (Christine
 Borgman, UCLA); Knowledge Management Systems:  A Text Mining
 Perspective (Hsinchun Chen, Univ. of Arizona); Digital Libraries:
  Theory and practice (Edward Fox, Virginia Tech); and Dublin Core
 (Stuart Weibel, OCLC).</p>  

<p>Topics for the ICADL invited talks included:  From Digital
 Library to Digital Government:  A Case Study in Crime Data 
Mapping and Mining (Hsinchun Chen, Univ. of Arizona); Challenges
 in Building the Digital Library for the 21st Century 
(Christine Borgman, UCLA); Dublin Core:   Process and 
Principle (Shigeo Sugimoto (ULIS, Japan), Stuart Weibel 
(OCLC), and Tomas Baker (GMD, Germany)); Building Digital 
Libraries Made Easy:  Toward Open Digital Libraries 
(Edward Fox, Virginia Tech); Examples of Practical Digital Libraries:
  Collections Built Internationally Using Greenstone (Ian Witten,
 University of Waikato, New Zealand); and Introduction of the China
 Digital Library Project (Zhang Xiaoxing, National Library of China).</p>

<p>The conference had received a record number of submissions&#151;a
combined total of 170 long and short papers&#151;and so the acceptance rate
 was a highly competitive 30%.  There were over 400 registrants
 to the conference, from 30 countries, attesting to a keen interest
 in digital libraries in the Asia-Pacific region and indicating that
 ICADL is attracting attention throughout the digital libraries 
research world.</p>

<p>A number of conference papers focussed on problems of
 particular concern to the Asia-Pacific region: difficulties
 in handling collections including multiple languages and/or 
multiple scripts, processing Chinese texts, problems involved 
with the digital divide, and developing resources under adverse 
economic circumstances.  With these latter issues, it was noted 
that while countries in the developing world struggle to provide
 access to expensive electronic information resources, wealthier 
countries that make these resources widely available must struggle
 to get their citizens to use them!</p> 

<p>Conference sessions were held at the Grand Hyatt Hotel just
 off Orchard Road, the famous Singapore boulevard of shops and 
restaurants. In December this street was bright with Christmas 
lights, the shopping malls were imaginatively decorated for 
the holiday season, and shoppers packed the area.  Fortunately 
the shops were open until 11pm or even later, allowing busy 
ICADL attendees to partake of Singapore's favorite 'sport' 
(bargain hunting) after the jam-packed sessions ended! 
Conference meals were fabulous, showcasing the justly famous 
(and diverse) Singaporean cuisine.  The conference dinner was 
held at the Alkaff Mansion,  a beautifully restored 19th century 
family home built in the British Colonial style.  The conference
 organizers thoughtfully arranged a city tour en route to the dinner.</p> 

<p>It was announced that the 2003 ICADL conference will be held
 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</p>
