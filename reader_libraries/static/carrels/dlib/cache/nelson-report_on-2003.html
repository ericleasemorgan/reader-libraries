 <p>The Third ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL 2003) was held on the campus of Rice University in Houston, Texas, May 27 - 31. Regarding the merging of the ACM and IEEE conference series, in the JCDL 2002 conference report published last year in <em>D-Lib Magazine</em> Edie Rasmussen noted, "Perhaps by next year...no one will remember that it wasn't always so" [<a href="07nelson.html#1">1</a>].  Judging by the number of participants I met who did not know that the ACM and IEEE used to hold
separate digital library conferences, Rasmussen's prediction
has come to pass.</p>

 <p>Conference Chair Geneva Henry reported that there were 321 attendees at JCDL 2003, 
representing 19 countries.  This is 
a decrease from JCDL 2001 (450 people, 20 countries) [<a href="07nelson.html#2">2</a>] and JCDL 2002
(479 people, 21 countries) [<a href="07nelson.html#1">1</a>].  Economic factors surely contributed to
the attendance downturn, along with the SARS epidemic and heightened security warnings from the US government at the time of JCDL 2003. Another factor may have been that hosting the conference at the end of May
(to avoid the infamous Houston summer heat) also overlapped with exams
in some European countries. </p>

 <p>This JCDL followed the same format as the preceding JCDL conferences. Several tutorials were offered on the first day, followed by three days of regular conference sessions, and JDCL 2003 closed 
with a day offering four workshops (see the <a href="../07inbrief.html">In Brief</a> column of this issue of <em>D-Lib</em> for workshop 
summaries) and two more tutorials.  (The number of tutorials offered at JCDL this year grew to 14.) Tutorials included a repeat of the popular topics from previous years, such
as "Overview of Digital Libraries", "Thesauri and Ontologies in Digital
Libraries", "How to Build a Digital Library Using Open-Source Software"
and introductory and advanced tutorials on the Open Archives Initiative
Protocol for Metadata Harvesting.  Two new tutorials for JCDL 2003
were "SRW: Z39.50 Next Generation" and "Audio/Video Digital Libraries". </p>

 <p>Cathy Marshall, Microsoft Corporation, chaired the Program Committee.  Paper selection was very
competitive:  23 of 91 full papers (25%) and 31 of 77 short papers (40%)
were accepted.  In addition to the papers, 41 posters presentations and project demonstrations
rounded out the JCDL 2003 program.  The popular "1-minute madness" format of
previous JCDLs was continued. During the "1-minute madness" presentations, each organization participating in the posters and demonstrations was given one minute in which to promote their concept or innovation in order to entice visitors to stop by during the reception later that evening. </p>

 <p>The technical program consisted of a mix of full papers (30 minute
presentations) and short papers (15 minute presentations), split in
two parallel sessions.  The papers covered many topics, including
audio/visual digital libraries, protocols and formats, educational
and scientific digital libraries, user interaction and design, and
metadata extraction.  Also featured were panel discussions on digital
library sustainability, hybrid physical/digital libraries, and digital
library accessibility.  Previous JCDL panels frequently focused on
formats, protocols and techniques; this year's panels offered insight into
the arguably more challenging areas of sustained use, operation and
impact of digital libraries. </p>

 <p>A fascinating and entertaining opening keynote address was given by
James Boyle, Duke University Law School professor and co-director of
the Center for the Study of the Public Domain.  Boyle's talk addressed
the current state of intellectual property laws, and some of the points
made in the talk are discussed in [<a href="07nelson.html#3">3</a>, <a href="07nelson.html#4">4</a>].  He began with the observation
that "the entire pudding of 20th century work is locked up because of
the raisin."  In other words, nearly all intellectual works covered by
copyright exhaust their commercial potential within the span of a few
years after publication.  While only the smallest percentage of works
(the "raisin") retain long-term economic viability, intellectual property
laws apply universally to all works ("the pudding").  He also argued
that while intellectual property laws address losses due to "piracy",
the laws also create losses (calculable in the same manner as piracy
losses) due to failed information-sharing.  Boyles also briefly discussed the Creative
Commons [<a href="07nelson.html#5">5</a>], a resource for authors wishing to utililize rights licenses that suit their needs rather than choosing  traditional copyright for their intellectual property. </p>

 <p>Tom Moritz, Director of Library Services at the American Museum of Natural
History, gave the closing keynote address which proved to be the perfect
bookend to the opening address.  Tom began his talk with a discussion
of his personal experience regarding the culture of sharing copies
of the <em>New York Times</em> on commuter trains to and from New York City.
He related the "arms race" for used newspapers that involved the city government (which desired to recycle
the papers), commuter train passengers (who desired to reuse the papers), and the
<em>Times</em> (which desired to prevent reuse in order to sell more copies of the newspaper).
Quoting heavily from various historical and contemporary sources, Tom
went on to extrapolate this anecdote on sharing of physical media to
the idea of information sharing and "fairness" in the digital world. </p>

 <p>The JCDL 2003 conference banquet was held at the Houston Museum of Natural Science.
Attendees were treated to a planetarium show about the sinking of
the Titanic and were able to take part in several interactive exhibits and games.  A delicious buffet was served with food and drink tables located throughout
the museum's many exhibits, including the very impressive Cullen Hall
of Gems and Minerals. This created an informal atmosphere for enjoying the exhibits as well as visiting with colleagues.</p>

<p>During the banquet, the Vannevar Bush Award for
Best Conference Paper was presented to Gary Marchionini for his paper
(joint with Barbara Wildemuth, Meng Yang, Gary Geisler, Todd Wilkens,
Anthony Hughes and Richard Gruss) "How fast is too fast?  Evaluating fast
forward surrogates for digital video".  This paper described the results
of a user evaluation study that examined user preferences and performance
after viewing "fast-forward" video surrogates.  (Based on the study results, the new Open Video digital library [<a href="07nelson.html#6">6</a>] will adopt the speed of 1:64 as the default fast-forward rate.) </p>

 <p>JCDL 2004 will be held in Tucson, Arizona June 7-11.  The focus for JCDL
2004 will be "Global Reach and Diverse Impact", in recognition of the
emerging themes from previous conferences in the areas of international
collaboration and applications [<a href="07nelson.html#7">7</a>]. The Call for Papers for JCDL 2004 has already been issued, and the submission deadline for full papers is 15 January 2004. (See the conference web site [<a href="07nelson.html#7">7</a>] for more information.) </p>
