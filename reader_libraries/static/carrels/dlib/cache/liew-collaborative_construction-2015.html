<h3>1 Background</h3>

<p>The cultures and tools afforded by the social Web have offered cultural heritage institutions (CHIs) (archives, libraries, galleries and museums) the opportunities to transform the services they provide as well as their relationships with their user communities and the wider public. CHIs are still a long way from reinventing themselves through the social Web however. Most CHIs still make restricted use of social media for basic functions like communicating general information and news, and promoting events, collections and services. Some have gone a bit further &#151; taking advantage of the participatory potential of the social Web to actively engage users and stakeholders in conversations about their collections and services.  Even fewer have involved carefully coordinated efforts of soliciting and providing meaningful ways for collaborative construction and enrichment of cultural heritage knowledge.</p>

<p>The success and sustainability of such endeavour are likely to depend considerably on the presence of a platform and system that supports sociability as a start &#151; one that facilitates social interaction and connectivity &#151; which could then potentially lead to sustained engagement and collaboration to achieve a shared goal.</p>

<p>The value and sustainability of online participatory projects depends on many factors. Each participant's interaction with the program is facilitated by technology. Hence, the usability of the project platform is undoubtedly important.  However, a broader view recognises that participants aim to interact not only with the project system, but with each other and with the professionals who are guiding the projects. Therefore the <i>sociability</i> of the project as a whole must be taken into account, and this is the focus of this research.</p>

<p>We define <i>online sociability</i> in the context of DCH as the extent to which the information and communication environment mediated by social media is perceived and/or believed to facilitate social interaction, engagement and meaningful participation.</p>

<div class="divider-full">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>2 Methodology</h3>

<p>A scoping study worked well to answer the research question: <i>What does the literature tell us about online sociability that could inform how participation in collaborative construction of DCH can be supported, motivated and sustained?</i></p>

<p>A scoping review was conducted with the aim of building on the recent advances in research on online sociability and participatory culture. Relevant literature were analysed and weaved together to map a pathway with motifs that could be useful as a guide for projects working towards collaborative construction of DCH. </p>

<p>An extensive literature survey was undertaken across various disciplinary fields (see <a href="11liew.html#appendix">Appendix 1</a>) including digital cultural heritage crowdsourcing and citizen science, e-commerce, educational and organisational psychology, sociology, media studies, online participatory culture and human-computer interaction to gain a broad snapshot of the factors that have been found and suggested as having an influence on online sociability in collaborative projects. </p>
 
<p>There are challenges involved in collating and interpreting this literature. One issue is that although online sociability is a concept which has received increasing recognition and attention within the field of computer science over the last decade, it is often studied in other fields without being labelled as such. For example, the past decade has seen extensive literature published examining the determinants of the overall success of participatory online cultural heritage programmes and online voluntary communities of purpose such as Wikipedia or open source software development networks. However, there are limitations on the information available in this area. Most published quantitative information on participation rates derives from those projects which were successful (Noordegraaf <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#30">2014</a>). Hence, there may be gaps in our knowledge of what hinders online sociability. </p>
 
<p>The available information on less successful participatory initiatives is also often anecdotal in the sense that it is usually published in summaries of experts' deductions from observations in the field, as in Ridge (<a href="11liew.html#46">2013</a>), or as case studies of single projects as in McClean (<a href="11liew.html#26">2011</a>). Furthermore, most qualitative information on participants' perceptions is gathered from the small proportion of active participants who answer surveys or comment in forums (Eveleigh <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#9">2014</a>; Raddick <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#42">2010</a>) and thus does not tell the full story of the majority of participants, who are also valuable members of any project, not only because of their combined production capacity but also because they act as "the essential audience" for others, and as ambassadors for the program and the institution in the wider community (Groenewegen &amp; Moser, <a href="11liew.html#11">2014</a>; Nonnecke &amp; Preece, <a href="11liew.html#29">2000</a>; Shirky, <a href="11liew.html#49">2010</a>).  Studies on participation in cultural heritage work also rarely use control groups and manipulation of variables to clearly establish causal relationships between variables, or validate participants' self-reported motivations with examination of each individual's actual participation rates under various conditions (Eveleigh <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#9">2014</a>; Nov, Arazy, &amp; Anderson, <a href="11liew.html#31">2011</a>, <a href="11liew.html#32">2014</a>). These are some of the reasons why a net was cast across various disciplines to identify as many factors and determinants as possible, without neglecting the context-specific insights available from within the DCH field itself. </p>
 
<p>The breadth of this literature review has created further challenges.  Participatory cultural heritage projects differ widely in their aims, content, structures and participant groups. Determinants of online sociability vary likewise. What motivates and encourages participants in one context can hinder sociability in another (Eveleigh <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#9">2014</a>; Ling <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#23">2005</a>; Nov <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#32">2014</a>; Ridge, <a href="11liew.html#45">2012</a>).  However, some commonalities have emerged consistently across the fields of practice and disciplines and these common determinants of online sociability are discussed in the next section. Key concepts and motifs are highlighted in bold.</p>

<div class="divider-full">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>3 Online Sociability Determinants in Collaborative Projects</h3>

<p>There are many ways to conceptualise the complex relationships between the myriad factors which affect social interaction, engagement and participation in collaborative projects.  Overviews of success factors have previously been arranged according to phases of project development (Noordegraaf <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#30">2014</a>), phases of participants' connection with the project (Rotman <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#48">2012</a>), or as simple checklists of considerations for planning (Holley, <a href="11liew.html#13">2009</a>, <a href="11liew.html#15">2010</a>; Romeo &amp; Blaser, <a href="11liew.html#47">2011</a>).</p>

<p>Determinants of online sociability according to Preece (Liao &amp; Chou, <a href="11liew.html#20">2012</a>; Preece, <a href="11liew.html#40">2001</a>) fall under three areas:</p>

<ul>
	<li style="padding-bottom: .5em;"><b>Purpose</b> &#151; Factors which enhance a community's shared focus</li>

	<li style="padding-bottom: .5em;"><b>People</b> &#151; Factors which satisfy participants' individual, social and organizational needs and allow participants to fulfil desired roles</li>

	<li><b>Policies</b> &#151; Factors such as protocols, norms, or informal and formal policies that support community governance</li>
</ul>

<p>Motifs and concepts in relation to participants' interactions with a project under each of these areas are organised according to: before and during initial contact; throughout participation and post-participation events. Many of these could actually be placed under more than one of these areas, as these facets of online sociability intersect with each other (Preece, <a href="11liew.html#40">2001</a>); and volunteer participation in collaborative programs is often cyclical rather than following a simple linear sequence of beginning, middle and end (Rotman <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#48">2012</a>).  However, this structure of reporting will provide some order for the wide array of determinants identified in the scoping study and review of the relevant literature.</p>

<div class="divider-dot">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>3.1 Purpose &#151; community's shared focus</h4>

<p><b><i>Before participation begins</i></b></p>

<p><b>Social ties</b> and <b>social capital</b> which exist outside of a project have been identified as beneficial for online sociability of a collaborative project.  Successful projects often identify a community with pre-existing social ties (Bak, <a href="11liew.html#1">2012</a>; Gao <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#10">2010</a>; Liao &amp; Chou, <a href="11liew.html#20">2012</a>). Some institutions benefit from investing time in building social capital with a community before asking them to contribute (Ransom, <a href="11liew.html#43">2008</a>).</p>

<p>Pre-existing interest in the topic or process of the enterprise is highly motivating for participants, as is indication of the <b>public good</b> that could result from the project. Hence, it is important to connect with the right <b>community of interest</b> (Causer, Tonra, &amp; Wallace, <a href="11liew.html#5">2012</a>; Holley, <a href="11liew.html#14">2009b</a>; Mankowski, <a href="11liew.html#25">2011</a>; NABPP, <a href="11liew.html#27">2009</a>; Noordegraaf <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#30">2014</a>; Raddick <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#42">2010</a>; Romeo &amp; Blaser, <a href="11liew.html#47">2011</a>; Shirky, <a href="11liew.html#49">2010</a>).  Communities with niche or local interests may be small, but they may also be passionate and socially well-integrated. Hence, they should not be neglected (Ransom, <a href="11liew.html#43">2008</a>).</p>

<p><b><i>As participants initially make contact with the project</i></b></p>

<p>The <b>goals and underlying purposes</b> of a collaborative project must be clearly presented and communicated to prospective participants, indicating the value and impact of the work and who could benefit from the project (Holley, <a href="11liew.html#14">2009b</a>; Liao &amp; Chou, <a href="11liew.html#20">2012</a>; Ling <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#23">2005</a>; Locke &amp; Latham, <a href="11liew.html#24">2002</a>; NABPP, <a href="11liew.html#27">2009</a>; Noordegraaf <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#30">2014</a>; Nov <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#31">2011</a>, <a href="11liew.html#32">2014</a>; Proctor, <a href="11liew.html#41">2010</a>; Ridge, <a href="11liew.html#45">2012</a>, <a href="11liew.html#46">2013</a>; Romeo &amp; Blaser, <a href="11liew.html#47">2011</a>; Yan &amp; Davison, <a href="11liew.html#52">2013</a>).  A key phrase or image for instance may be helpful to focus the attention of first-time visitors to the project site (Bitgood, <a href="11liew.html#2">2010</a>). </p>

<p>It must also be clear whether the information contributed will be added to the official record or an existing repository and in what way (Liew, <a href="11liew.html#21">2014</a>; Rotman <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#48">2012</a>). Data should be shared openly as soon as possible and the project should inform volunteers when it has been made openly available. This has been found to increase participants' trust in the organisation and the project concerned. This has also been found to also appeal to volunteers' <b>altruistic or collective motivations</b> for contributing to a meaningful cause, as well as their desire to be recognised for their efforts (Eveleigh <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#9">2014</a>; Romeo &amp; Blaser, <a href="11liew.html#47">2011</a>).</p>

<p><b><i>Throughout participation</i></b></p>

<p>Provision of a large and quantified challenge has been found to be effective in maximising participants' motivation and contribution rates (Ling <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#23">2005</a>; Locke &amp; Latham, <a href="11liew.html#24">2002</a>; Romeo &amp; Blaser, <a href="11liew.html#47">2011</a>). <b>Indications of progress</b> towards this big goal are integral to the success of this strategy, both for project productivity and for participants' satisfaction and wellbeing (Deci &amp; Ryan, <a href="11liew.html#8">2000</a>; Holley, <a href="11liew.html#15">2010</a>; Locke &amp; Latham, <a href="11liew.html#24">2002</a>; Romeo &amp; Blaser, <a href="11liew.html#47">2011</a>). Showing that the community is active builds volunteers' confidence that their efforts will be reciprocated (Gao <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#10">2010</a>; Liao &amp; Chou, <a href="11liew.html#20">2012</a>; Nov <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#32">2014</a>).</p>

<p>Establishing a shared vocabulary and 'common language' builds <b>a sense of belonging</b> to the project community, and thus, encourages participation (Liao &amp; Chou, <a href="11liew.html#20">2012</a>).</p> 

<p><b>Supporting offline interaction</b> and integration of the project with the <b>wider community</b> have also been found to reinforce altruistic motivations and participation rates by demonstrating the value of volunteers' work (Liew, <a href="11liew.html#21">2014</a>; Rotman <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#48">2012</a>).</p>

<p>As the aims and purposes of the project evolve, the project must keep participants and potential participants informed, for instance of any changes in short-term goals and policies (Chung &amp; Lampert, <a href="11liew.html#7">2011</a>).</p>

<div class="divider-dot">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>3.2 People &#151; individual, social and organizational needs and roles</h4>

<p><b><i>Before participation begins</i></b></p>

<p>Engagement with cultural heritage exhibitions or projects has been conceptualised as a process in which a prospective volunteer balances the perceived costs of participation, such as effort and time, against perceived benefits, whether to self or others, such as learning, fulfilment of needs or alignment with values and principles (Bitgood, <a href="11liew.html#2">2010</a>; Haefliger <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#12">2011</a>; Ye &amp; Nov, <a href="11liew.html#53">2013</a>). These benefits may be experienced during participation in a task, as intrinsic motivators such as fun or a sense of altruism which arise inherently from the task itself; or they may result indirectly from the completion of the task, as extrinsic motivators such as social status (Ye &amp; Nov, <a href="11liew.html#53">2013</a>).</p>

<p>This decision-making process occurs both at the moment of initial interaction with the project, and cyclically throughout the volunteer's participation, most noticeably at certain common exit points, such as the end of a task (Rotman <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#48">2012</a>). Therefore, sustained involvement in a project relies on an environment in which participants generally experience <b>low barriers</b> and <b>positive benefits</b> from participation.</p>

<p><b><i>As participants initially make contact with the project</i></b></p>

<p>Most authors agree that entry barriers should be as low as possible (Phillips, <a href="11liew.html#39">2013</a>; Proctor, <a href="11liew.html#41">2010</a>; Ridge, <a href="11liew.html#45">2012</a>). Accreditation through required training may increase some volunteers' commitment to the project (Rotman <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#48">2012</a>), and initial registration may in some cases encourage first-time visitors that the community is trustworthy (Virtanen &amp; Malinen, <a href="11liew.html#51">2008</a>). However these procedures may be ineffective or even counterproductive in attracting and retaining the majority of potential participants, and should be used with care.</p>

<p>The first task presented to a participant must be encouragingly easy (Chung &amp; Lampert, <a href="11liew.html#7">2011</a>; Eveleigh <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#9">2014</a>; Noordegraaf <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#30">2014</a>; Phillips, <a href="11liew.html#39">2013</a>; Proctor, <a href="11liew.html#41">2010</a>; Ridge, <a href="11liew.html#45">2012</a>, <a href="11liew.html#46">2013</a>).  <b>Clear, detailed instructions</b> should be provided (Holley, <a href="11liew.html#14">2009b</a>; Noordegraaf <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#30">2014</a>); but task completion should also be guided by <b>scaffolding</b> in the form of constraints and visual cues, as it is best to show as well as to tell (Liew, <a href="11liew.html#22">2013</a>; Ridge, <a href="11liew.html#46">2013</a>; Proctor, <a href="11liew.html#41">2010</a>; Locke &amp; Latham, <a href="11liew.html#24">2002</a>).  In addition, participants who can see others' contributions as examples reported feeling more confident and this has been found to lead to them producing higher quality work (Lee, Hsu, &amp; Chang, <a href="11liew.html#19">2013</a>; Locke &amp; Latham, <a href="11liew.html#24">2002</a>). Tasks should be divided into small chunks (Eveleigh <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#9">2014</a>; Mankowski, <a href="11liew.html#25">2011</a>; Nov <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#31">2011</a>; Rotman <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#48">2012</a>).  These measures show a first-time participant that the cost of getting started is low.</p>

<p>At this decisive initial contact phase, a prospective volunteer also needs to see that the potential benefits are high.  <b>Feedback on successful task completion</b> (Eveleigh <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#9">2014</a>; Noordegraaf <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#30">2014</a>; Ridge, <a href="11liew.html#46">2013</a>), and a choice of clearly <b>graduated levels of difficulty</b> (Eveleigh <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#9">2014</a>), demonstrate that even casual participants can quickly gain intrinsic motivation and confidence from their success. Participants have been found to be highly motivated by <b>learning opportunities</b> at this stage (Rotman <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#48">2012</a>). So it is essential to show what or how participants can learn from their input (Bitgood, <a href="11liew.html#2">2010</a>; Chou, <a href="11liew.html#6">2010</a>; Liao &amp; Chou, <a href="11liew.html#20">2012</a>; Nov <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#32">2014</a>; Verhagen <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#50">2012</a>).  However, Ling <i>et al</i>. (<a href="11liew.html#23">2005</a>) and Oum &amp; Han (<a href="11liew.html#37">2011</a>) sound a word of warning here: volunteers have strong altruistic and intrinsic motivations, and may react negatively to assert their autonomy against messages which they perceive as manipulative or insincere marketing.  As in many areas of project planning, the best ways to strike the right balance are to show, rather than to tell (Ling <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#23">2005</a>); and to test the project interface with a small group of pioneer volunteers from the target audience (Ridge, <a href="11liew.html#45">2012</a>, <a href="11liew.html#46">2013</a>; Romeo &amp; Blaser, <a href="11liew.html#47">2011</a>).</p>

<p><b><i>Throughout participation</i></b></p>

<p>To maintain a participant's engagement with the project, the perceived cost of participation must remain low. An easy, quick, reliable interface with navigable information architecture has been found to limit friction and barriers (Bonastre &amp; Granollers, <a href="11liew.html#3">2014</a>; Ridge, <a href="11liew.html#45">2012</a>; Romeo &amp; Blaser, <a href="11liew.html#47">2011</a>), and supports <b>confidence building</b> and <b>experimentation</b> with the technology, improving users' impressions of the project and increasing participation rates (Chou, <a href="11liew.html#6">2010</a>).</p>

<p>Again, the perceived benefits must be high. In this regard, there are several types of factors which have been found to contribute to participants' sustained engagement with projects.</p>

<p>Participants derive intrinsic motivation from a <b>sense of autonomy</b>. Therefore, a choice of options and of patterns of participation is important (Deci &amp; Ryan, <a href="11liew.html#8">2000</a>; Eveleigh <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#9">2014</a>; Oomen <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#34">2013</a>; Romeo &amp; Blaser, <a href="11liew.html#47">2011</a>).  </p>

<p>Ongoing <b>learning</b> and <b>personal growth</b> are also meaningful for participants and have been found important to sustain their engagement with a project (Deci &amp; Ryan, <a href="11liew.html#8">2000</a>). Projects can maximise learning opportunities and make progress salient by continuing to supply new or increasing challenges (Holley, <a href="11liew.html#14">2009b</a>; Noordegraaf <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#30">2014</a>; Nov <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#32">2014</a>), and by enabling individuals to monitor their own progress and set their own targets (Eveleigh <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#9">2014</a>), especially within a session (Locke &amp; Latham, <a href="11liew.html#24">2002</a>).</p>

<p>Connected with personal growth are issues of <b>self-expression and identity building</b>, which are important to members of many online communities.  A program can allow self-expression by representation of identity via the use of unique names and avatar images, and of opinions via discussion forums (Chou, <a href="11liew.html#6">2010</a>; Zollers, <a href="11liew.html#55">2007</a>). Recognition of individuals' actual contributions is vital (Chou, <a href="11liew.html#6">2010</a>; Eveleigh <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#9">2014</a>; Gao <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#10">2010</a>; Holley, <a href="11liew.html#14">2009b</a>; Huang &amp; Benyoucef, <a href="11liew.html#16">2013</a>; Liao &amp; Chou, <a href="11liew.html#20">2012</a>; Romeo &amp; Blaser, <a href="11liew.html#47">2011</a>), and there are many ways in which this can be offered. The key for project designers is to "recognise what you want to reinforce" &#151; for example, measure and reward quality as well as quantity if this is what is required (Nov <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#32">2014</a>).  Allowing participants to view each others' contributions can help them to build status or reputation (Groenewegen &amp; Moser, <a href="11liew.html#11">2014</a>), and as has previously been noted, this is one of the reasons why low contributors are valuable to a project, as they form the majority of the "essential audience" which promotes motivation for high contributors. Therefore, all participants' input should be encouraged and appreciated (Groenewegen &amp; Moser, <a href="11liew.html#11">2014</a>; Nonnecke &amp; Preece, <a href="11liew.html#29">2000</a>; Shirky, <a href="11liew.html#49">2010</a>). The relationship between low and high contributors can be mutually beneficial when participants can see each others' work, as low contributors often feel more confident to attempt tasks if they can observe before acting. Other features which may help to retain low contributors or tempt them to return include choices, easy well-defined tasks and opportunities to set short-term goals (Locke &amp; Latham, <a href="11liew.html#24">2002</a>). On the other hand, high contributors may be rewarded by competitive features such as leader tables, or social rewards such as opportunities to take leadership or moderator roles (Eveleigh <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#9">2014</a>; Holley, <a href="11liew.html#15">2010</a>; Liao &amp; Chou, <a href="11liew.html#20">2012</a>). This type of reputation-based reward is usually classified as an extrinsic motivator, but these rewards have been found to have the potential to enhance volunteers' <b>enjoyment</b> of the task itself (Nov <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#32">2014</a>).  </p>

<p>Participation in DCH construction can also enhance volunteers' sense of identity outside of the program. Participants may be motivated by accreditation of the skills developed or training undertaken within the program, by attribution on publications or other public-facing literature resulting from their contributions, or by messages showing when their data was used (Rotman <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#48">2012</a>).  Simply making a project's site or results easy to share via other social media can encourage volunteers to show their wider social networks what good work they are doing in their spare time, as well as potentially attracting more participants (Romeo &amp; Blaser, <a href="11liew.html#47">2011</a>).</p>

<p><b>Conversation</b> between the volunteers and professionals involved in a program, and between participants, is widely identified as essential to participants' perceptions that their contribution is meaningful and rewarding (Bonastre &amp; Granollers, <a href="11liew.html#3">2014</a>; Bray <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#4">2011</a>; Gao <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#10">2010</a>; Holley, <a href="11liew.html#14">2009b</a>; Lee <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#19">2013</a>; Oum &amp; Han, <a href="11liew.html#37">2011</a>; Proctor, <a href="11liew.html#41">2010</a>; Ridge, <a href="11liew.html#45">2012</a>; Romeo &amp; Blaser, <a href="11liew.html#47">2011</a>). Project staff should be clearly tasked with the responsibility of responding to participants' messages and actively inviting questions and suggestions from volunteers (Liew, <a href="11liew.html#21">2014</a>; Chung &amp; Lampert, <a href="11liew.html#7">2011</a>), as well as responding to participants as equals in the endeavour (Mankowski, <a href="11liew.html#25">2011</a>; Rotman <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#48">2012</a>). Project organisers and participants alike can benefit especially from the insights of the most active volunteers, or those who make the highest quality contributions (Gao <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#10">2010</a>; Nov <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#32">2014</a>; Proctor, <a href="11liew.html#41">2010</a>).</p>

<p>Productivity, enjoyment and intention to continue are heightened when participants feel deeply immersed in an activity. High engagement can be engendered by factors such as <b>telepresence</b>, which is the feeling that a user is immersed in a virtual environment and is communicating with others within that environment (Kwon &amp; Wen, <a href="11liew.html#18">2010</a>; Oum &amp; Han, <a href="11liew.html#37">2011</a>); or a <b>sense of playfulness</b> (Oum &amp; Han, <a href="11liew.html#37">2011</a>). This can be a challenge for designers, as what is fun and diverting for one individual may be annoying or distracting for another (Organisciak, <a href="11liew.html#36">2010</a>), but it is worth aiming for (Lee <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#19">2013</a>; NABPP, <a href="11liew.html#27">2009</a>; Verhagen <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#50">2012</a>) by taking into consideration the suitability of activities for the context concerned.  Game-like activities suit some participant groups (Nov <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#32">2014</a>; Oomen &amp; Aroyo, <a href="11liew.html#35">2011</a>), while simply allowing for the possibility of unexpected discoveries, and for conversation about those unexpected finds, is preferable for others (Mankowski, <a href="11liew.html#25">2011</a>; Romeo &amp; Blaser, <a href="11liew.html#47">2011</a>).  Interaction with and between participants in close to real time enhances a sense of sociable telepresence, especially when personal opinions and identities can be expressed (Lee <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#19">2013</a>).</p>

<p><b>Flow states</b> were originally described by Csikszentmihalyi in 1975 as cases of maximal engagement in a task, and have received ongoing attention in the psychological literature (Deci &amp; Ryan, <a href="11liew.html#8">2000</a>; Ridge, <a href="11liew.html#46">2013</a>; Yan &amp; Davison, <a href="11liew.html#52">2013</a>). Individuals experiencing "flow" feel so highly focused and engrossed in a task that they can lose track of time; and flow states are instrinsically motivating, as the experience is so enjoyable.  Flow states require a level of challenge which is optimally matched to an invidual's self-perceived ability, and clear immediate feedback on the success of the individual's attempts. To provide the potential for flow states, an interface should limit distractions and unnecessary difficulties (Bitgood, <a href="11liew.html#2">2010</a>; Bonastre &amp; Granollers, <a href="11liew.html#3">2014</a>; Ridge, <a href="11liew.html#45">2012</a>; Romeo &amp; Blaser, <a href="11liew.html#47">2011</a>), lead smoothly from one task or chunk to the next (Eveleigh <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#9">2014</a>), provide feedback on successful task completion (Ridge, <a href="11liew.html#46">2013</a>), and provide graduated levels of difficulty so that each task is challenging, but not too difficult as to be discouraging. </p>

<p><b><i>Post-participation, or between participation sessions</i></b></p>

<p>Former participants may return to active involvement and could function as ambassadors for the program and the institution concerned. <b>Continued communications</b> about the project, especially news of interesting new events or opportunities, are often both welcome and have been found to have an effect on continuous engagement and productivity, and maintaining a sense of community (Bonastre &amp; Granollers, <a href="11liew.html#3">2014</a>; Liao &amp; Chou, <a href="11liew.html#20">2012</a>). </p>

<div class="divider-dot">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>3.3 Policies &#151; protocols; norms; informal and formal policies; community governance</h4>

<p><b><i>Before participation begins</i></b></p>

<p>Projects can identify themselves with their parent institutions by using the familiar visual language, web space and logos of the parent site (Bonastre &amp; Granollers, <a href="11liew.html#3">2014</a>), but they will then rely on the goodwill and trust which has been created over time by the interactions of the organisation with its community (Ransom, <a href="11liew.html#43">2008</a>). As has previously been noted, <b>clearly stated aims, purposes and policies</b> of the project must be easily accessible so that participants can see how their contributions will be managed and used, i.e. are their contributions altered, merged with existing content, shared openly, archived and/or open for reuse? (Liew, <a href="11liew.html#21">2014</a>).</p> 

<p><i><b>As participants initially make contact with the project</b></i></p>

<p>At initial contact, participants need to know that the project, the institution, and the volunteer community are <b>trustworthy</b>, especially if they will be asked to contribute personal information, such as family stories or photographs (Bonastre &amp; Granollers, <a href="11liew.html#3">2014</a>; Chou, <a href="11liew.html#6">2010</a>). Demonstrating the trustworthiness of the volunteer community is less directly controllable by the project organisers. Requiring participants to register is one option, but it is no fail-safe guarantee of courteous behaviour in online communities (O'Neil, <a href="11liew.html#33">2010</a>; Reagle, <a href="11liew.html#44">2012</a>).  A better strategy is to allow potential participants to view the community's recent activity, so they can judge for themselves whether the culture is one in which they can feel at home. Some correspondents in online communities also feel more secure when they can see each other's demographic details, such as home town or gender (Virtanen &amp; Malinen, <a href="11liew.html#51">2008</a>). <b>Clear statements of expectations</b> can also help to set the scene (Holley, <a href="11liew.html#15">2010</a>).</p>

<p><b><i>Throughout participation</i></b></p>

<p><b>Ongoing moderation</b> has been found helpful in making participants feel safe and allows them to spend their time on productive contributions or discussions, instead of on conflict resolution (O'Neil, <a href="11liew.html#33">2010</a>; Reagle, <a href="11liew.html#44">2012</a>).  Participants perceive that an online community is sociable and successful when they believe that they will receive supportive feedback when they ask questions, share unique opinions, or try new things (Locke &amp; Latham, <a href="11liew.html#25">2002</a>; Mankowski, <a href="11liew.html#25">2011</a>; McClean, <a href="11liew.html#26">2011</a>; Rotman <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#48">2012</a>; Yu, Lu, &amp; Liu, <a href="11liew.html#54">2010</a>).  However, many volunteer communities are highly trustworthy, requiring minimal moderation, and respond well to respectful recognition of this fact (Holley, <a href="11liew.html#14">2009b</a>).  Each project must weigh its unique circumstances and consider how, and how much, the organisers will attempt to influence the project community (Haefliger <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#12">2011</a>).  In large or ongoing DCH projects, organisers can progressively support and <b>empower</b> participants to <b>co-moderate</b> the community themselves in accordance with agreed guidelines (Liew, <a href="11liew.html#22">2013</a>; Nov <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#31">2011</a>, <a href="11liew.html#32">2014</a>; Ridge, <a href="11liew.html#45">2012</a>; Proctor, <a href="11liew.html#41">2010</a>).  Experienced participants also derive satisfaction, motivation and a sense of community from opportunities to guide or mentor each other; and newer volunteers can gain confidence and improve their contributions through this process (Jahnke, <a href="11liew.html#17">2010</a>; Nov <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#31">2011</a>, <a href="11liew.html#32">2014</a>; Proctor, <a href="11liew.html#41">2010</a>).</p>

<h3>4 A 'Pathway' Towards Collaborative Construction of Digital Cultural Heritage</h3>

<p>This study is an attempt to gain a preliminary understanding of what factors could be important in facilitating and supporting online sociability in DCH projects that involve participation and collaborative construction of cultural heritage knowledge. An inter- and cross-disciplinary literature review was conducted with an aim to scope the literature to uncover main factors and motifs that influence online sociability of collaborative projects. These were discussed in the previous section and in this section a preliminary 'pathway' is presented (see Figure 1). The aim of this is to map and summarise the main motifs that have been found in previous studies to affect online sociability in collaborative and participatory projects. The pathway is expected to provide a reference for researchers, to serve as a research roadmap and to stimulate new ideas in future research on this topic. It is also expected to provide practitioners in DCH projects an overview of key motifs that influence online sociability that they could consider in their projects.</p>

<p>The scoping review shows that although there are many existing projects to look to as models, there is no single recipe for planning participatory and collaborative programs. Project managers and coordinators are encouraged to "plan for the audience you want" (Ridge, <a href="11liew.html#45">2012</a>), as no two projects or volunteer groups are exactly alike (Eveleigh <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#9">2014</a>; Ling <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#23">2005</a>; Nov <i>et al</i>., <a href="11liew.html#32">2014</a>). Results and reactions can be surprising, and many initiatives have achieved success by starting small and designing iteratively in response to participant feedback (Ridge, <a href="11liew.html#45">2012</a>; Romeo &amp; Blaser, <a href="11liew.html#47">2011</a>). Open communication with participants about the development process is critical to maintaining trust in these cases and also to empower participants to take ownership in guiding the growth of the project.</p>

<p>Further research is needed to empirically validate the relevance of these determinants of online sociability and to uncover other determinants that may be applicable to DCH projects. It would be useful to develop an integrative research framework which can be used to inform institutional policy and to guide practice decisions when developing and nurturing sustainable cultures of participation in collaborative construction of DCH and other similar endeavours.</p>
