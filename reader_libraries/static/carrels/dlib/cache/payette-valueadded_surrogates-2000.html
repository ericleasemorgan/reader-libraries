<H3>1. Introduction</H3>

 
<p>The distributed nature of digital libraries presents both an opportunity and a challenge. The ability to compose, aggregate,
and transform content from distributed heterogeneous sources makes it possible to present users with new and customized
resources. However, providing access to these new resources, while maintaining the integrity of a traditional library
environment, is often problematic. With the distribution of content, services and users, institutions face a formidable task
in providing reliable service, protecting the privacy of users and rights of content providers, and ensuring the long-term
preservation of digital content that may not be in their direct control. </P>
 
<p>The issue of integrity in digital libraries is the focus of our research at Cornell University in <A HREF="http://prism.cornell.edu/main.htm">Project Prism</A>, a part of <A HREF="http://www.dli2.nsf.gov">Digital
Libraries Initiative Phase 2</A>. Prism is a four-year collaboration between the Cornell University Library, the
Human-Computer Interaction Group, the Cornell Digital Library Research Group, and the Library of Congress to
investigate the organizational and technical aspects of maintaining integrity when content and services are distributed.</P>
 
<p>Our initial experiments in Prism build on existing work in new architectures for digital objects and repositories. The
FEDORA digital object architecture [<a href="06payette.html#ref10">10</a>] permits the aggregation of heterogeneous content and the association of extensible
behaviors with those aggregations. We have shown that this architecture is an effective tool for providing uniform access
to a mixture of objects distributed among multiple repositories [<a href="06payette.html#ref9">9</a>]. Recently, we have been investigating the
integration of policy enforcement into the <A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/cdlrg/FEDORA.html">FEDORA</A> architecture, with applications to both access management and
preservation [<a href="06payette.html#ref11">11</a>].</P>
 
<p>Our research in providing integrity for distributed information environments has demonstrated a new application of the
Fedora architecture. We originally conceived of Fedora as a tool for creating containers of content and associated
metadata, in the manner of the Warwick Framework [<a href="06payette.html#ref7">7</a>]. Recently, we have begun to use Fedora as a vehicle for creating
surrogates for distributed content. These <I>Value-Added Surrogates</I> can be used to enhance the functionality of the
content and provide a framework for implementing integrity-enforcing mechanisms. Services such as data integration,
access control, and preservation monitoring can be implemented in a uniform and interoperable manner, even though
underlying data sources may be heterogeneous and highly distributed. By creating repositories of Value-Added
Surrogates, institutions can create a <I>virtual control</I> zone to implement curatorial responsibilities over resources not in
their direct control. In effect, the establishment of a virtual control zone allows institutions to manage selected Internet
resources in a manner that approximates the care they can provide for resources contained within their physical
boundaries. </P>
 
<p>From a technical perspective, the V-A Surrogate is a type of <I>mediator</I>, as described by Wiederhold [<a href="06payette.html#ref14">14</a>]. According to
Wiederhold, mediators reside between raw data sources and end-user applications where they integrate and transform data
to fit higher-level abstractions in support of real-world problem solving. Along the same lines, Paepke [<a href="06payette.html#ref8">8</a>] discusses
mediation for its role in facilitating interoperability for digital libraries. Mediation technologies such as "wrappers" and
"proxies" can provide clients the "illusion of a highly integrated system" while underlying system components can
maintain a high degree of autonomy in their implementation. Mediation has also been highlighted as a technique for
converting and integrating semi-structured data on the Web [<a href="06payette.html#ref1">1</a>]. In the object-oriented realm, there is a design pattern
known as a mediator that encapsulates and coordinates the interactions of multiple objects [<a href="06payette.html#ref5">5</a>].</P>
 
<p>The Value-Added Surrogate extends the notion of a mediator beyond its typical roles -- e.g., data conversion, exchange,
integration. Value-added surrogates can fulfill these functions, but also fulfill unique usage and integrity requirements of
distributed content objects in digital libraries. Like mediators, V-A surrogates encapsulate service requests or queries <I>upon</I>
one or more data sources. The V-A surrogate does not actually store the content, but obtains it as needed from the
external source. The key advantage of the V-A Surrogate, however, is that it is able to provide specialized services not
inherent in the original data source. In our research, we are particularly interested in using these augmented services to
facilitate integrity in digital libraries.</P>
 
<p>In this paper, we describe our experiments with different types of V-A Surrogates. First, we introduce the notion of a
<I>virtual control zone</I> for digital libraries and how V-A Surrogates can be used to define the boundaries and types of control
for distributed objects. Then we describe our implementation of V-A Surrogates as Digital Objects using our Fedora
architecture. In section 4, we describe the different roles that V-A Surrogates can play: the <I>Booster</I>, the <I>Guard</I>, the <I>Caretaker</I>, and the <I>Auditor</I> to address the basic challenges of distributed digital libraries. In section 5, we describe our
experiments with V-A Surrogates for access control, reference linking, and preservation. </P>
 

<H3>2. Creating a Virtual Control Zone with V-A Surrogates</H3>

 
<p>Ross Atkinson [<a href="06payette.html#ref2">2</a>] describes the notion of the <I>control zone</I> to characterize the manner in which libraries define boundaries
of responsibility. According to Atkinson, libraries have traditionally defined the control zone via the principle of
physical containment -- custodial obligations are assumed for those objects within the walls of the institution. </P>
 
<p>The Internet has increasingly challenged this well-defined boundary. Wishing to facilitate access to rich Internet content,
libraries have often responded by cataloging selected networked content. The creation and maintenance of these <I>catalog surrogates</I> effectively extends the library collection outside its traditional boundaries. Rather than acting solely as a
container for content, the library becomes a <I>portal</I> to content controlled and managed by external organizations.</P>
 
<p>Although the cataloging surrogates are instrumental in extending the access zone of the library, they fail to extend or
redefine the <I>control</I> zone. Simply cataloging Web resources essentially forsakes the integrity role that is so important to
libraries. Our work with Value-Added surrogates is guided by the principle that a more powerful mechanism is necessary
to create a <I>virtual control zone</I>. By controlling a repository of Value-Added Surrogates that map to external resources,
an institution effectively defines the boundaries of its virtual control zone. The functionality of each surrogate provides a
means of defining and implementing the level of responsibility that the institution assumes for each external resource.
V-A Surrogates can be deployed with varying levels of granularity: they can represent individual resources, selected groups
of resources, or external collections as a whole. </P>
 
<p>The functionality of surrogates and of the virtual control zone is highly correlated with the levels of cooperation that exist
among institutions. As with many digital library solutions, automated mechanisms for asserting control in a distributed
environment co-exist with human and organizational realities. As a result, V-A Surrogates may implement well-defined
responsibilities shared between trusted partners, or they may represent best-effort attempts of an organization to assert
some degree of influence or monitoring over external resources that are completely out of their physical control. This
section describes a number of scenarios along this control and cooperation spectrum. </P>
 
<H4><I>Cooperative Relationships</I></H4>
 
<p>Cooperative agreements have historically enhanced the functionality of individual libraries. For example, agreement
among libraries on cataloging standards and MARC encoding has facilitated widely practiced sharing of cataloging
records. Initiatives such as the <A HREF="http://www.cic.uiuc.edu">Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC)</A> have made it possible for libraries to extend
their catalogs beyond institutional boundaries. Recently, with the availability of an increasing number of digital resources,
libraries have entered into new types of agreements for distributing responsibility for these resources. For example, an
agreement between the Library of Congress and Bell and Howell Information and Learning Company (formally UMI)
effectively cedes some of the Library's custodial responsibility for dissertations to Bell and Howell while stating a
fail-safe provision to ensure their long-term preservation.</P>
 
<p>Value-Added surrogates enable and empower such cooperative relationships by creating a mechanism for uniformly
automating provisions of such agreements. Some examples of the use of V-A surrogates for such cooperative
arrangements are as follows. </P>

              <UL>
              <p><LI><I>Delegating Responsibility</I> - Content providers sign a variety of licensing agreements with libraries and similar
              information intermediaries. For example, a license with the Cornell library might provide free access for all
              students with for-cost access to alumni. A license with the Stanford library, on the other hand, might
              mandate for-cost access to all affiliated people. Rather than implementing the details of the agreement itself, the
              provider might cede such responsibility to the licensing party. This might involve the provider granting access to a
              certified library server that stores V-A Surrogates that are capable of providing specific access controls per the
              license agreement. In section 5, we describe specific experiments with such V-A surrogates for enhanced access
              management. </li></p>
              <p><LI><I>Partitioning Responsibility</I> - Another model of cooperation recognizes that some aspects of access and
              management are generic, while others should be tailored for individual users and institutions. For example, parties
              may enter into a trusted relationship where they agree that content provider will act as long-term custodian for data,
              but the accessing institution will be responsible for providing user interface services for data presentation.
              Accessing institutions could then use V-A surrogates to tailor the interfaces to the objects in a manner appropriate for
              their clientele. </li></p>
              <p><LI><I>Sharing Standards</I> - Yet another scenario is where cooperating providers and consumers agree to an interoperability
              strategy that enhances functionality of the content. For example, the latest version of the SFX linking software [<a href="06payette.html#ref13">13</a>]
              relies on a cooperative strategy in which content providers supply so-called "OpenURLs" that are then used by
              accessing portals to afford enhanced linking behavior. In section 5, we describe related work that uses V-A
              surrogates to provide uniform linking functionality for distributed content.</li></p> 
              </UL></p>

 
<H4><I>Mitigation of Vulnerability</I></H4>
 
<p>While Value-Added Surrogates can implement functionality defined through cooperative relationships, such cooperation is
sometimes impractical or unavailable. In such cases, a V-A Surrogate will be limited in the level of control and integrity
that it can enforce. Nevertheless, we can imagine some useful roles for V-A surrogates in such a context.</p>

<p><UL>
              <p><LI><I>Monitoring and Logging</I> - Value-Added surrogates might serve as a means of uniformly monitoring 3rd party
              resources. Surrogates could collect data about the uptime and availability of distributed resources and log access
              errors. These logs could be used as data for subsequent preservation decisions. </li></p>
              <p><LI><I>Selective Actions</I> - Value-Added surrogates might also assume a more proactive role in a non-cooperative
              environment. Brewster Kahle's Internet Archive takes an eager and non-selective approach to Internet archiving.
              A more selective and lazy approach might be more appropriate in other contexts. For example, an institution might
              use V-A surrogates to monitor selected sites, deemed valuable by a library, and take preemptive actions such as
              "cache content locally if it is unavailable 50% of time." Individual surrogates could provide varying levels of such
              proactive behavior based on the perceived value of the respective content.</li></p> 
              </UL></p>
 
<H3>3. Digital Object Architecture for V-A Surrogates</H3>

 
<p>V-A Surrogates require an architecture that supports (1) aggregation of distributed content accessed via a variety of
protocols, (2) association of rich and extensible behaviors with that content, (3) modular mechanisms to provide mediation
capabilities, and (4) an open interface to promote uniformity and interoperability. Although these requirements can be
implemented in a number of ways, we have used our Fedora implementation as a basis for experimentation. Several years
ago, we designed Fedora to enable <I>Digital Objects</I> and <I>Repositories</I> to meet the above requirements. Since then,
we have implemented this model using object-oriented technology, and have demonstrated its flexibility and
interoperability through collaborations with the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) and others [<a href="06payette.html#ref9">9</a>]. The digital library research and development group at
the University of Virginia has also implemented the Fedora model using a relational schema and web technologies.
Virginia has created a testbed containing over 30,000 Digital Objects that aggregate metadata and content from several
pre-existing EAD and image collections. </P>
 
<p>A brief review of the Fedora model will illuminate our V-A Surrogate discussion. Fedora is a modular architecture for
Digital Objects, built on the principle that interoperability and extensibility is best achieved by the clean separation of
data, interfaces, and mechanisms. A Fedora Repository provides a general-purpose management layer for Digital
Objects. In their simplest form, Digital Objects are containers that aggregate mime-typed streams of data (e.g., digital
images, XML files, metadata), known as <I>DataStreams</I>. Clients can interact with Fedora Digital Objects through a set of
<I>generic</I> methods, collectively known as the <I>Primitive Disseminator</I>. This provides a well-defined and open interface
for all Digital Objects. </P>
 
<p>In addition to behaving in a generic manner, Digital Objects can provide content-specific functionality. For example, a
natural behavior for a book would be "Get Table of Contents." Fedora allows the association of rich and extensible
behaviors with Digital Objects by "plugging in" generic components known as <I>Typed Disseminators</I>. Each Disseminator
aggregates references to: (1) a formally defined <I>behavior interface</I> that specifies a set of methods for running a particular
type of digital library service (e.g., Lecture Browser interface, Image preservation interface), and (2) an <I>executable
mechanism</I> that runs these methods. These interfaces and mechanisms are themselves disseminated by Digital Objects,
laying the foundation for unlimited and persistent extensibility of the architecture. A major strength of the Fedora
extensibility model is that clients can use the generic interface of a Digital Object to discover and invoke type-specific
methods defined in Typed Disseminators. The Digital Object facilitates the invocation of these extended methods,
returning customized <I>disseminations</I> of content to the client. </P>
 
<p>Figure 1 shows our use of Fedora Digital objects as V-A Surrogates. In this application, DataStreams are actually
<I>encapsulated service requests</I> upon external sources. The requests can be upon other Fedora Digital Objects, or upon
other data sources (e.g., web servers, databases, online catalogs). In Fedora, these encapsulated requests are known as
<I>ReferenceDataStreams</I>. The referenced content can be manipulated, integrated, secured, or augmented by associating a
Typed Disseminator with the container. Within the Disseminator are references to shared specifications and
mechanisms to perform the mediation work. All communication with the V-A Surrogate is through the generic interface.
In section 5, we will describe specific examples of V-A surrogates implemented in this manner.</P>

<p>Collections of V-A Surrogate objects are stored in Fedora Repositories. A Repository provides a management layer for
Digital Objects. Repositories should be implemented as secured servers, so that they can enter into trusted relationships
with source content servers. Figure 2 shows a collection of V-A Surrogates, each playing a different <I>role</I>. These roles --
the <I>Booster</I>, <I>Guard</I>, <I>Caretaker</I>, and <I>Auditor</I> -- represent the different functions that V-A Surrogates can fulfill. These
functional abstractions are described in the next section.</P>

<H3>4. Roles of Value-Added Surrogates</H3>

 
<p>Value-Added Surrogates can address different functions, including behavior augmentation, access control, preservation, and
auditing. We have created a set of abstractions that essentialize the roles surrogates can play in adding value to distributed
content. These roles are not exhaustive, nor are they mutually exclusive. Any particular V-A Surrogate could exhibit
aspects of one or more roles. Nevertheless, these basic abstractions help clarify the purpose(s) of particular surrogates in
digital library implementations. </P>

<H4><I>Booster (behavior-augmented surrogate)</I></H4>

<p>A Booster surrogate is used to add or extend behavior for content aggregations. Also known as a <I>behavior-augmented
surrogate</I>, it "boosts" the functionality of the base content to which the surrogate refers. Booster surrogates can be
used to deliver new presentations of existing content, to provide integrated views of formerly unrelated content, or to
create complex objects with new capabilities. Although all types of V-A Surrogates augment functionality in some
manner, the Booster abstraction is used to distinguish functionality that improves access-oriented behaviors of content.
As such, this new functionality will provide visible results to end-users.</P>
 
<p>A simple example of augmenting the behavior of content is providing on-the-fly conversion of images that are aggregated to
form a journal article. A more complex example is a Booster surrogate that delivers multimedia views of lecture content.
The basic underlying content of the lecture -- a digitized video and a set of related slides -- can be brought to life by adding
behaviors to provide synchronized disseminations of the two content sources (e.g., the right slides with the right video
segments), and ability to locate relevant segments using keyword searching. In section 5, we describe Booster surrogates
that apply dynamic reference linking behavior to documents from multiple sources. </P>
 

<H4><I>Guard (policy-augmented surrogate)</I></H4>

<p>Another variation of the V-A Surrogate is the <I>Guard</I>, also known as a <I>policy-augmented surrogate</I>. Guard surrogates
enable the enforcement of fine-grained access control policies customized to meet content-specific requirements. Like all
V-A Surrogates, the Guard aggregates references to distributed content and associates a set of behaviors with the
aggregation. In addition, it associates a <I>security policy</I> and an <I>enforcement mechanism</I> with the content to restrict access
via the defined object behaviors.</P>
 
<p>Access control mechanisms in digital libraries must be scalable, flexible, and extensible  accommodating a wide range of
objects and usage scenarios. Standard operating system based access controls do not provide the basis for highly
expressive policy enforcement because they support a relatively fixed set of abstractions (e.g., files, nodes) and actions
(e.g., reading, writing, etc.).</P>
 
<p>Our earlier example of a license agreement between a library and a 3rd party information provider offers an example where
traditional approaches to access control may be insufficient. In such arrangements, libraries are permitted to provide
access to a remote resource via their digital library portals, given that these portals are equipped to restrict access to the
licensed resource by unauthorized users. A typical means of fulfilling this requirement is IP checking, which essentially
approximates the identity of users based on incoming network addresses. This is a rather coarse policy that does not
easily scale to handle other scenarios pertinent to particular applications and complex objects. For example, it is difficult
to enforce policies that require a distinction between students and faculty, or policies that restrict access to
sub-components of a source (e.g., table of contents is available to anyone, but full-text is restricted). </P>
 
<p>V-A Surrogates can be used to enforce access control policies that are fine-grained and tailored to the customized
functionality of complex objects -- in a uniform and modular manner. In section 5, we describe how V-A Surrogates
implemented in the Guard role can be used to enforce more expressive policies over distributed content, while also
promoting architectural uniformity and interoperability. </P>
 

<H4><I>Caretaker (preservation-augmented surrogate)</I></H4>

 
<p>The Caretaker is a <I>preservation-augmented surrogate</I> that can contribute to the long- term management and care of
distributed content. The Caretaker abstraction is designed to support the notion that objects can participate in their own
preservation. V-A Surrogates in this role can take on responsibilities such as (1) disseminating information relevant to
preserving content, (2) detecting undesirable conditions that could affect the longevity of content, or (3) initiating action to
protect content. </P>
 
<p>For example, a Caretaker can perform diagnostic tests on distributed content to assess its health. At a minimum, the
surrogate can disseminate metadata about the <I>state</I> of the distributed content to which it refers. More significantly, a
Caretaker can take action to protect its underlying content. Depending on the level of trust and cooperation that exists
between a V-A Surrogate repository and an external source, a Caretaker can initiate migration or conversion tasks upon
source content. </P>
 
<p>A Caretaker surrogate can work independently, or it can collaborate with system-wide services that manage large
distributed collections. For example, in our Prism Project we are designing a <I>preservation service</I> that interacts with
Caretaker surrogates in two ways. First, it uses them to collect data about the state of select resources. Then it uses
them as mechanisms for initiating preservation actions such as creating mirrors or format migration. </P> 

<H4><I>Auditor (inspection-augmented surrogate)</I></H4>

<p>A close relative to the Guard and the Caretaker, the Auditor is a V-A Surrogate whose purpose is to apply a degree of
scrutiny over content that is not in one's direct control. While the Guard and Caretaker assume an active role in security
and preservation of content, the Auditor is more passive in its duties. The Auditor abstraction acknowledges the reality
that our control over distributed content may be quite limited, or our trust in source providers may not be strong. When all
else fails, we can at least monitor resources and track events that may be leading indicators of potential problems, or
indicative of new trends (i.e., in usage, performance, availability). </P>
 
<p>The Auditor is the least mechanically robust of the V-A Surrogates. Its main role is to alert us to problems or trends, and to help in
decision making. These V-A Surrogates can be used to gather the requisite information to prompt human intervention.
Auditors can monitor resources in many ways, such as tracking the frequency of "404" errors on web resources, testing the
volatility of resources by comparing periodic checksums of data, or logging usage statistics. The information collected can
be the impetus for action,  the creation of new agreements, the definition of new policies, or the institution of new practices. </P>
 

<H3>5. Selected Experiments </H3>

<H4><I>V-A Surrogates for Security and Access Control</I></H4>

 
<p>We have implemented the Guard abstraction to apply access controls to distributed content in our Prism testbed. Using
Fedora, we have created V-A Surrogates that enforce security policies. Our test source is the Cornell Computer Science
Lecture Archive, which stores multi-media representations of courses taught by the department. Content includes digitized
videos, slides, and XML-encoded metadata.</P>
 
<p>A typical way to implement a guard surrogate is to represent a delegation of responsibility pattern between trusted partners. For
this scheme to work in a secure manner, a source provider must grant a V-A Surrogate repository access rights to its
content but prevent direct access by other users and applications. The source trusts that the surrogate repository will
implement access control according to agreed upon terms. The surrogate repository expects that the source is secure so
that users can't sneak in a back door and avert all access controls. A benefit of this approach is that institutions can
manage surrogate repositories to tailor policies to its own requirements. Different institutions can apply different policies
to the same shared, distributed content. Also, an institution can create fine-grained policies that define different access
conditions for different parts of a source. </P>
 
<p>Figure 3 depicts a V-A Surrogate for a lecture. There are multiple DataStreams in the surrogate that reference particular
pieces of external content from the lecture archive: a low-resolution video of a lecture (Video-L); a high-resolution version
of the video (Video-H); a set of accompanying slides (Slide-1, Slide-2, etc.); and an XML file that encodes both
synchronization and descriptive metadata. Although it is not apparent in the diagram, the Disseminator (labeled Guarded
Lecture Mechanism) not only references a secured mechanism, but also a formal definition of access methods for this type of
object. As suggested by the watchdogs in the diagram, the V-A Surrogate acts as a Guard, overseeing the execution of all
methods that can be invoked to gain access to underlying content. </P>

<p>What we have achieved with these V-A Surrogates is the ability to enforce fine-grained policies that are not easily
accommodated by more general-purpose access control schemes that treat resources in a non-specific manner. Each V-A
Surrogate stores or references an encoded policy that is customized to the particular requirements of the object. If a
policy happens to be applicable to all lectures, it can be stored centrally and applied by default to all lecture surrogates.
In our example, a policy is stored as Datastream in the surrogate object. It specifies that, for this lecture, the
high-resolution video is accessible only by students, but that other users can view the low-resolution video for a fee.
Furthermore, some of the slides are proprietary, so the policy states that only students can view these (e.g., slide #21 to
#25). Any user can view the other slides. </P>
 
<p>From a technical perspective, our Guard functionality is implemented in the form of <I>In-line Reference Monitors (IRMs)</I>
using Cornell's PoET security software [<a href="06payette.html#ref3">3</a>, <a href="06payette.html#ref4">4</a>]. A discussion of the application of IRM technology to Fedora Digital
Objects, and the implications for digital library security, can be found elsewhere [<a href="06payette.html#ref11">11</a>]. Briefly, PoET is a toolkit that
provides a policy definition language and a policy enforcement mechanism based on Schneider's <I>security automata</I> theory
[<a href="06payette.html#ref12">12</a>]. In PoET, Java applications are converted to <I>secured</I> applications by a code rewriter that embeds checks into Java
Machine Language programs (bytecode). When the programs run, the policy is enforced. An easy way to understand this
is to imagine PoET "baking" program executables so that policies becomes ingrained within them. Using this technology,
we dynamically and securely apply access control policies to V-A Surrogate mechanisms at run time. </P>
 

<H4><I>V-A Surrogates for Reference Linking</I></H4>

<p>In the The Open Citation Project [<a href="06payette.html#ref6">6</a>] we are experimenting with an application of the <I>Booster</I> abstraction to facilitate
linking among distributed objects. In order to interlink heterogeneous distributed archives we have been exploring the use
of <I>link-friendly surrogates</I>. As shown in Figure 4, these Value-Added Surrogates point to both an original document,
available from an external document server, and a <I>CiteRef</I> database that is typically constructed via prior analysis of a
collection of documents. The V-A Surrogate adds reference-linking functionality to the source document (e.g., a report
from the Los Alamos <A HREF="http://www.arxiv.org">arXiv</A> repository) via a mechanism that integrates documents and metadata.</P>
 
<p>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1"><B><I>Figure 4: V-A Surrogate (Booster) adds reference linking to source document</I></B></FONT></CENTER></P>  <BR>

<p>This work is built on the architectural presumption that document inter-linking has distinctly separate <I>data</I> and
<I>consumption</I> layers. In the data layer, documents should supply structured information about references (outbound
links) and citations (inbound links). Our work with V-A Surrogates has been in defining and implementing the
architecture of the data layer. This first involves the definition of a <I>linking API</I> for documents, which includes the
following service requests:</P>
 
<p> <UL>
<p><LI>GetReferenceList - Return the list of creations (documents) referenced by this document.</li></p>
<p><LI>GetCurrentCitationList - Return the list of known citations of this document.</li></p>
<p><LI>GetLinkedText - Return full document content with embedded data about its references.</li></p>
<p><LI>GetMyData - Return citation metadata for this document in a canonical format.</li></p>
 </UL></P>
 
<p>These service requests will return relevant data in an XML format. Information disseminated from the surrogates (i.e.,
data layer) can be consumed in a variety of ways. Within the consumption layer of the linking architecture, we have
defined two general classes of clients: <I>presentation clients and analysis clients</I>. Presentation clients render the linking
data into human usable forms including simple presentation of references as hyperlinks, displays of metadata about a
referenced document, or even vocalization of link information for sight-impaired users. Analysis clients consume linking
information from a set of documents for varying types of statistical analysis.</P>
 
<p>Maintenance of V-A Surrogates to provide the functionality of the data layer of the reference-linking scheme provides a
number of benefits, including:</P>
 
<p><UL>
<p><LI>Non-uniform documents, such as those in different formats or encodings, can be presented to linking services in a uniform manner.</li></p> 
<p><LI>An institution can customize linking behavior in a per-document manner according to its individual needs. This is similar to but extends the dynamic linking behavior of systems like SFX [<a href="06payette.html#ref13">13</a>].</li></p> 
<p><LI>Processing to facilitate linking can be accomplished in both an eager (prior analysis) or lazy (on-demand) fashion.</li></p> 
<p><LI>As link analysis tools improve (such as referencing parsing tools developed by our Southampton partners), we can easily incorporate them into our surrogates to improve link functionality.</li></p> 
</UL></P>
                                                                                                   
 

<H4><I>V-A Surrogates for Preservation</I></H4>

<p>We are in the early phases of our research of V-A Surrogates that bring preservation-oriented functionality to digital
content. The motivation for this work is the belief that digital objects should be able to participate in their own
preservation. We are not proposing self-preserving objects; instead we are designing preservation-augmented surrogates
that will be <I>participants</I> in a broader preservation service architecture.</P>
 
<p>Figure 5 depicts our preliminary design for the Caretaker surrogate and its intended interaction points with a preservation
service node. Initially, these surrogates will provide information about the status of the its underlying digital content.
Ultimately they will be capable of multiple functions, including the preparation of customized views of content change
history and the issuing of problem alerts. </P>

<FONT SIZE="-1"><B><I>Figure 5: V-A Surrogate (Caretaker) helps images participate in their preservation</I></B></FONT></P>  
                               
 
<p>As part of our Prism research, we are investigating metadata models that are capable of expressing significant <I>events</I> in the
life course of a digital object. This metadata will form the basis of monitoring functionality for V-A Surrogates, and the
broader preservation service. V-A Surrogates will disseminate views of this metadata (XML-encoded) for a preservation
service to interpret. Additionally, some V-A Surrogates will be equipped with mechanisms to provide direct
interpretations of this event metadata. As part of our research, we are examining conditions under which this analysis
functionality should reside in surrogates vs. external services that leverage surrogates.</P> 
 
<p>Ultimately, automated interpretations of event metadata will yield preservation <I>action</I>. This could include anything
from sending a report to assist in human decision making, copying content to a caching server, converting content to new
formats, or moving content to a certified archive. We intend to explore the notion of <I>preservation policy enforcement</I> by
extending the work we have done in security and access control. Using similar notions of policy and mechanism, we will
experiment with mechanisms to enable surrogates to detect unacceptable or risky transitions in underlying content, with the
goal of initiating a preservation response -- either automated action or alerts with information to promote human
intervention.</P>
 
<H3>6.  Summary</H3>

<p>We have designed a form of digital object known as the Value-Added
Surrogate that can enhance the functionality of digital content that is
not in one's direct control.   The Fedora Digital Object model is the
basis for the V-A Surrogate design.  Initially, Fedora was designed to
aggregate distributed content and associate a set of behaviors with that
content.   The flexibility of the Fedora model has enabled its use as a
mediation architecture for improving access and integrity for
distributed content.  We have discussed four types of V-A Surrogates for
augmenting content functionality:  (1) the Booster for adding new
access-oriented behaviors, (2) the Guard for applying access control,
(3) the Caretaker for helping to preserve content, and (4) the Auditor
for implementing monitoring capabilities.  A major benefit of the V-A
Surrogate architecture is that it allows for significant flexibility in
adding functionality to content, while also providing architectural
uniformity.</p>

<p>An institution can create repositories of V-A Surrogates to create a
virtual control zone for valuable content that is not in its direct
control.   Unlike other surrogates, such as catalog records for internet
resources, the V-A Surrogate lets institutions implement specific usage
and integrity requirements upon the referenced content.   Although the
institution may not directly manage the source content, the V-A
Surrogates for that content are under its direct stewardship.</p>  

<p>Institutions can increase the power of their V-A Surrogates through
cooperative agreements with source content providers.  In such
agreements, providers may delegate or share responsibilities.  By
establishing a trusted relationship between a source server and a V-A
repository, the source provider can grant institutions the right to
develop customized views of data, apply context-specific access
controls, or even take other action to ensure integrity.  Even when such
agreements are not possible, an institution can still implement V-A
Surrogates to apply a limited amount of customization to content,
including monitoring and inspection of content.</p>
