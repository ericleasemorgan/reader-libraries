<p>
The second annual JCDL Doctoral Consortium was held at JCDL 2006 on Sunday, June 11, 2006.  Seven Ph.D. students participated, along with six faculty and practitioner mentors.  
</p>

<p>
The consortium was a full day, with each of the students presenting their doctoral research and receiving feedback from the mentors. The seven participants, at varying stages in their doctoral work, were invited to participate in the consortium after a review of the papers they submitted for consideration.  Each showed considerable promise and a likelihood of benefiting from the intimate setting offered by the consortium.   The students were Ron Brown, School of Information and Library Sciences, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; Frank McCown, Computer Science Dept., Old Dominion University; Carlos Monroy, Center for the Study of Digital Libraries, Texas A&amp;M University; Mike Perrow, IDIAP Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland; David Portabella Clotet, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology - EPFL; Joan A. Smith, Computer Science Dept., Old Dominion University; and Hong Xu, School of Library and Information Science at University of North Texas.  The accompanying faculty mentors were Ray R. Larson (Chair), University of California, Berkeley, USA, School of Information Management and Systems; Geneva Henry (accompanying practitioner), Rice University, Houston, USA, Rice Digital Library Initiative; Rudi Schmiede, Darmstadt University of Technology, Germany, Department of Sociology; Ingeborg Solvberg, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway, Department of Computer and Information Science; Birger Larsen, Department of Information Studies, Royal School of Library and Information Studies, Denmark; and Edward A. Fox, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) USA, Department of Computer Science.
</p>

<p>
The research topics presented by the students included a study of information seeking behaviors of K-12 teachers in using a digital video archive; innovative research for automatically archiving web site source code for subsequent retrieval and redeployment; use of digital library techniques for reconstructing sunken ships from a variety of archeological and treaty information; research into named entity identification in genealogical networks for automatically determining genealogy trees; an approach to improving electronic catalog interfaces; innovative research for automatically preserving digital objects in an Apache web server; and a study into the factors affecting faculty attitudes towards institutional repositories.  The students each gave a 20-minute presentation of their research, then received feedback from the accompanying faculty.  The consortium provided an opportunity for the students to receive broader and more international perspectives on the scope and direction of their research topics.  The forum also provided an opportunity for the students to get to know each other better and provide peer-level feedback.  At the end of the day, the group retreated to the Top of the Hill restaurant for a relaxing dinner sponsored by Rice University, providing an opportunity for more personal interactions between the participants.
</p>

<p>
The students will be submitting final versions of their papers that will be made available online, along with their presentations, in September 2006.  These will be found at &lt;<a href="http://dspace.rice.edu/handle/123456789/17">http://dspace.rice.edu/handle/123456789/17</a>&gt;.  Papers and presentations from the inaugural JCDL Doctoral Consortium, held at JCDL 2005, are already available at this location.  Doctoral students interested in participating in the 3rd annual JCDL Doctoral Consortium, to be held in Vancouver, BC, Canada during the 2007 JCDL conference, 17 - 23 June 2007, should watch the conference site for details announcing submission guidelines and dates.
