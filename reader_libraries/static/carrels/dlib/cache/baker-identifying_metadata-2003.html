<H3 class="blue">Abstract</H3>

<P class="blue">On 18 November 2002, at a meeting organised by
the CORES Project (Information Society Technologies Programme,
European Union), several organisations regarded as maintenance
authorities for metadata elements achieved consensus on a
resolution to assign Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)
to metadata elements as a useful first step towards the
development of mapping infrastructures and interoperability
services. The signatories of the CORES Resolution agreed to
promote this consensus in their communities and beyond and
to implement an action plan in the following six months.
Six months having passed, the maintainers of GILS, ONIX,
MARC 21, CERIF, DOI, IEEE/LOM, and Dublin Core report on
their implementations of the resolution and highlight issues
of relevance to establishing good-practice conventions for
declaring, identifying, and maintaining metadata elements more
generally.  In June 2003, the resolution was also endorsed
by the maintainers of UNIMARC.</P>

<!-- Story goes next --> 


<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>The "Resolution on Metadata Element Identifiers", or CORES
Resolution, is an agreement among the maintenance organisations
for several major metadata standards &#151; GILS, ONIX, MARC 21, 
UNIMARC, CERIF, DOI&#174;, IEEE/LOM, and Dublin Core &#151; to identify their
metadata elements using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)
[<a href="07baker.html#CORES-RESOLUTION">CORES-RESOLUTION</a>].  The Uniform Resource Identifier, defined
in the IETF RFC 2396 as "a compact string of characters
for identifying an abstract or physical resource", has been
promoted for use as a universal form of identification by
the World Wide Web Consortium [<a href="07baker.html#BERNERS-LEE">URI, BERNERS-LEE</a>].  The CORES
Resolution, formulated at a meeting organised by the European
project CORES in November 2002, included a commitment to
publicise the consensus statement to a wider audience of
metadata standards initiatives and to implement key points of
the agreement within the following six months &#151; specifically,
to define URI assignment mechanisms, assign URIs to elements,
and formulate policies for the persistence of those URIs.</P>

<P>This article marks the passage of six months by reporting
on progress made in implementing this common action plan.
After presenting the text of the CORES Resolution and its
three "clarifications", the article summarises the position
of each signatory organisation towards assigning URIs to its
metadata elements, noting any practical or strategic problems
that may have emerged.  These progress reports were based on
input from Thomas Baker, Jos&#233; Borbinha, Eliot Christian, Erik Duval, Keith
Jeffery, Rebecca Guenther, and Norman Paskin.  The article
closes with a few general observations about these first
steps towards the clarification of shared conventions for the
identification of metadata elements and perhaps, one can hope,
towards the ultimate goal of improving interoperability among
a diversity of metadata communities.</P>

<H3>1. The CORES "Resolution on Metadata Element Identifiers"</H3>

<blockquote><em>Whereas:</em>
   <ul>
       <li><em>our metadata standards have "elements" &#151; units of
       meaning comparable and mappable to elements of other
       standards,</em></li></ul>
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote><em>We agree:</em>
   <ul>
       <li><em>to assign Uniform Resource Identifiers to our elements</em>;</li>
       <li><em>to articulate and publish specific policies regarding
       the stability, persistence, and maintenance of the
       URIs assigned to the elements</em>.</li>
   </ul>
   </blockquote>

<blockquote><em>Clarifications</em></blockquote>

   <blockquote>
   <ol>
       <li><em>This resolution promotes the use of URIs
       for identifying metadata elements.  However, there
       is no expectation that these URIs will be used to
       represent those elements within particular application
       environments &#151; e.g., to include them in instance
       metadata records or use them in SQL queries.  Rather,
       the intent is to offer a common citation mechanism
       usable, when needed, for purposes of interoperability
       across standards</em>.</li></ol>
       <ol start="2"><li><em>While the resolution focuses on the
       identification of individual metadata elements,
       URIs should also be used to identify other relevant
       entities at various levels of granularity, such
       as sets of elements (schemas) and the terms and
       sets of controlled vocabularies of metadata values.
       Deciding which of its own entities are important or
       salient enough to be assigned URIs is the prerogative
       of a particular Standards-Developing Organization</em>.</li></ol>
       <ol start="3"><li><em>This resolution specifies the use of URIs
       as identifiers with no requirement or expectation
       that those URIs will reference anything on the
       World Wide Web, such as documentation pages or
       machine-understandable representations of metadata
       elements</em> [<a href="07baker.html#CORES-RESOLUTION">CORES-RESOLUTION</a>].</li>
   </ol>
   </blockquote>

<H3>2. GILS</H3>

<P>The Global Information Locator Service (GILS) standard is a
simplified profile of the international standard for networked
search, ISO 23950 (also known as ANSI/NISO Z39.50 [<a href="07baker.html#GILS">GILS</a>,
<a href="07baker.html#Z39-50">Z39-50</a>]). A GILS-compliant server maps local data elements
to well-known bibliographic concepts.  This semantic mapping
achieves broad interoperability of search across all manner
of data and information. In addition a GILS-compliant server
must, on request, convert local structured data into one or
another canonical form using a specific schema. Retrieval
records generated with this GILS schema are known as "locator
records" and are designed to help search catalogs, directories,
and other types of metadata.</p>

<p>The GILS search concepts are part of the ISO 23950
"attribute set" known as Bib-1 [<a href="07baker.html#BIB1">BIB1</a>], and the data elements
of the GILS schema were originally defined in the GILS
Profile [<a href="07baker.html#GILS-PROFILE">GILS-PROFILE</a>]. These concepts and data elements
were formalized to follow the principles of ISO 11179, an
international standard for metadata registries, as part of the
process of establishing the ISO Basic Semantic Register (BSR)
[<a href="07baker.html#GILS-SEMANTICS">GILS-SEMANTICS</a>]. The international standards process has not
converged on a common URI mechanism for referencing the entries
in such a metadata registry.  However, the GILS maintenance office
(at the US Geological Survey) has suggested an approach that
would be in keeping with the CORES Resolution.</P>

<P>The suggested approach builds on two crucial characteristics
of the BSR: that the BSR can be reasonably well represented
as an XML Schema or RDF Schema, and the requirement that each
of the many thousands of BSR concepts and data elements has
a unique identifying number. For instance, a "keywords" data
element could reference the BSR-registered GILS data element
named "Subject-Terms-Uncontrolled". This GILS data element
has the unique identifier "1133.541.1207.96", where "1133"
corresponds to the English token "Information Resource",
"541" to "Subject"; "1207" to "Uncontrolled Term", and "96"
to "Group". This data element could be referenced in an RDF
Schema version of the ISO BSR through a URI such as</P>

<blockquote>
    <b class="blue">http://www.gils.net/bsr-gils.rdfs#1133.541.1207.96</b>
    </blockquote>

<p>There is currently much activity aimed at implementing
broad-scale semantic and metadata registries using the
principles of ISO 11179, including work within OASIS Technical
Committees.  As many of the issues around semantic register
services have yet to be worked out in the standards community,
however, the GILS office cannot yet commit to more than a
suggestion for how to reference GILS elements with URIs.</p>

<H3>3. ONIX and DOI</H3>

<P>The Digital Object Identifier System is a system for
persistently identifying and managing intellectual property
in the digital environment. The system is centered around
the DOI &#151; an identifier consisting of a prefix and a suffix
separated by a slash (e.g., <b class="blue">10.1234/1234567</b>),
which persistently identifies a content object of relevance to
an intellectual property transaction and associates it with
relevant data and services.  DOIs are also associated with
attributes descriptive of the content object identified,
and these are an essential component in the provision of
services related to intellectual property.  The DOI Metadata
System provides a mechanism for mapping the terms of any known
scheme into a common dictionary, the &lt;in<em>d</em>ecs&gt; <em>Data Dictionary</em>,
to support the transformation of metadata from one scheme into
the terms of another.  The system is developed and maintained
by the International DOI Foundation (IDF), a membership
organisation aiming to provide a framework for managing
intellectual content, for linking customers with content
suppliers, for facilitating electronic commerce, and enabling
automated copyright management for all types of media [<a href="07baker.html#DOI">DOI</a>].</P>

<P>ONIX is an international standard for representing
and communicating book industry product information in
electronic form [<a href="07baker.html#ONIX">ONIX</a>]. It provides an XML message format for
exchanging information between systems, which may, internally,
use different metadata systems. ONIX data elements have been
defined for product information &#151; message headers, reference
and product numbers, authorship, subject, publisher, and
the like &#151; for books, videos, and related media products.
As a standard, ONIX is maintained primarily by EDItEUR, a
membership organisation focused on standards for electronic
commerce in the book and serials industries.</P>

<H4>3.1 A shared dictionary for IDF and EDItEUR</H4>

<P>IDF and EDItEUR have supported the CORES Resolution as an
important first step in the direction of interoperability.
However, they both consider the precise identification
of metadata elements to be a necessary but not sufficient
condition for real interoperability.  Rather, interoperability
requires tools and mechanisms for ensuring the semantic
equivalence of terms from disparate schemes.</P>

<P>As both communities have built on work of the original
&lt;in<em>d</em>ecs&gt;&#153; Project (INteroperability of Data in E-Commerce
Systems), IDF and EDItEUR are currently collaborating to
improve interoperability between the DOI system and ONIX by
mapping their metadata elements to the &lt;in<em>d</em>ecs&gt; <em>Data Dictionary</em>
(<em>iDD</em>) [<a href="07baker.html#DOI-ONIX">DOI-ONIX</a>].  Based on &lt;in<em>d</em>ecs&gt; methodology, the <em>iDD</em> has
been developed to support the <em>MPEG21 Rights Data Dictionary</em> by
providing a semantic bridge between schemes and dictionaries
describing intellectual property resources of any form.
The <em>iDD</em> will provide a shared dictionary of metadata elements
(terms) to underpin both the DOI Metadata System and ONIX.</P>

<P>A detailed explanation of the technical basis of the <em>iDD</em>
is given in the recent <em>DOI Handbook Edition 3</em> and in the
full specification of the <em>MPEG 21 Rights Data Dictionary</em>
[<a href="07baker.html#DOI-HANDBOOK">DOI-HANDBOOK</a>, <a href="07baker.html#MPEG21">MPEG21</a>].  All Terms used in ONIX messages and
DOI Metadata Declarations will be mapped into the <em>iDD</em>, creating
a network of equivalences and other relationships in support
of metadata functions such the transformation of metadata
from the Terms of one scheme to another and the use of Terms
from different schemes together in cross-domain applications.
ONIX will use this as a tool for mapping terms from non-ONIX
metadata schemes, while the DOI system will use this as its
primary tool for associating metadata from various sources
with DOI-identified entities for advanced functions such
as multiple resolution.</P>

<P>Use of the <em>iDD</em> will mean that ONIX metadata will be usable
in the DOI system (and vice versa) via a central, one-to-one
mapping rather than through multiple uncoordinated crosswalks
between different schemes.  As currently planned, terms mapped
to the <em>iDD</em> will include all of the terms in ONIX 2.1, the DOI
Kernel (the mandatory metadata set associated with every DOI),
the DOI Resource Metadata Declaration (an extended metadata
set with an XML schema), the CrossRef Metadata Declaration
(widely used in the serials publishing sector), and the ISO
<em>MPEG-21 Rights Data Dictionary</em>.  Further access and use of the
<em>iDD</em> for searching and look-up functions will be determined by
IDF and EDItEUR according to their community needs.  The <em>iDD</em>
will be searchable from the IDF Web site, but the business
aspects of making this available beyond the circle of DOI
users have yet to be determined.</P>

<H4>3.2 URI assignment policies</H4>

<P>Terms in the <em>iDD</em> will be assigned URIs in the form of DOIs
[<a href="07baker.html#DOI-RFC">DOI-RFC</a>].  Syntactically, a DOI can include any alphanumeric,
case-insensitive string of unlimited length, which supports
both an &lt;in<em>d</em>ecs&gt; identifier (iid) as used in the <em>iDD</em> and the
short alphanumeric tags used in ONIX.  In order to distinguish
DOIs for elements from DOIs for content objects, IDF currently
uses numeric prefixes for all content objects (e.g., <b
class="blue">10.1234/</b>), and reserves specific prefixes for
administrative purposes, such as <b class="blue">10.ap/????</b>
for Application Profiles and <b class="blue">10.ra/????</b>
for Registration Agencies (where <b class="blue">????</b>
indicates a variable suffix string).  A likely prefix for
identifying a metadata element in the &lt;in<em>d</em>ecs&gt; <em>Data Dictionary</em>
would therefore be <b class="blue">10.iid/</b>, though no final
decision on this has yet been reached.</P>

<P>For the suffix, one option would be to adopt ONIX tags,
such as <b class="blue">&lt;b245&gt;</b>.  In URL and URI
syntax, however, angle brackets require hex encoding (i.e.,
<b class="blue">%3c</b> and <b class="blue">%3e</b>), so it is
preferable to omit these, as in the identifier string <b
class="blue">10.iid/b245</b>.</P>

<P>For example, the <em>iDD</em> element <b
class="blue">TranslatorSourceLanguage</b> ("A Language from
which a Translator worked in making a Translation") has the
iid <b class="blue">b252</b> and results in the identifier</P>

<blockquote>
    <b class="blue">doi:10.iid/b252</b>
    </blockquote>

<P>This string would be published as a URI and made
resolvable for users with access to the <em>iDD</em> ontology
repository.  The <em>iDD</em> ontology repository, in turn, would
express the logical relationships of this element to other
defined elements, such as <b class="blue">Creation</b>, <b
class="blue">Translator</b>, <b class="blue">Translation</b>,
<b class="blue">SourceOfTranslation</b>, and <b
class="blue">Language</b>, thus facilitating the transformation
and integration of data among a diversity of DOI Application
Profiles and ONIX message schemes.</P>

<H3>4. MARC 21</H3>

<P>MARC ("MAchine Readable Cataloging") was developed in the
1960s as a standard record format for computerised library
catalogues. It has evolved over the years into "MARC 21"
&#151; a family of related standards for functions such as
describing all types of resources in any physical format
("bibliographic records"), providing locations and holdings
for those resources ("holdings records"), identifying people
and organisations ("authority records"), and classifying the
intellectual content of resources ("subject headings" and
"classification"). MARC 21 code lists provide standardised
designations for languages, countries, geographic areas,
organisations, information sources, and types of relationships
between names and works ("relators"). "MARC 21" refers
both to a standard syntax and to a rich set of data elements. It
may be expressed syntactically using the standard ISO 2709
(<em>Format for Information Exchange</em>), which defines how
MARC records may be communicated, or using MARCXML, which is
an XML schema that uses MARC content designators. The Metadata
Object Description Schema (MODS), which derives from MARC,
is an XML schema that includes a subset of MARC bibliographic
data elements expressed as language-based tags. The MARC 21
family of standards is maintained by the US Library of Congress
[<a href="07baker.html#MARC21">MARC21</a>, <a href="07baker.html#MODS">MODS</a>]. The provision of persistent URIs for the
"elements" of this large and diverse set of standards will
proceed in stages.</P>

<H4>4.1. The short term: URIs for MARC and MODS elements</H4>

<P>In the short term, "http:" URIs will be assigned for MARC
and MODS content designators (e.g., elements and sub-elements
and for MARC 21 indicators and values).  These URIs will enable
any MARC or MODS element to be referenced without ambiguity.
Initially, this assignment will take the form of a statement
detailing methods for constructing the URIs along with
policies regarding their persistence.  Assignment methods may
also be formulated to provide URIs for values in controlled
MARC/MODS value lists.  The precise methods have yet to be finalised, since there are issues that
have yet to be decided, so the examples below should be understood as
tentative.
It should be possible to establish persistence policies
and URI assignment policies by the second half of 2003.
Actually assigning the URIs will probably take less time for
MODS elements than for all MARC elements. The entire process
is expected to take perhaps one year.</P>

<P>As an initial test case, the Library of Congress will also
publish the URIs for terms in the MARC Code List for Relators
in a schema document using XML and Resource Description
Framework (RDF). Made available in response to a request from
the DCMI Usage Board, this document will declare semantic
relationships between the MARC Relator terms and a term from
Dublin Core (<b class="blue">contributor</b>) in a form that
can easily be incorporated into RDF-based "registries" of
metadata terms. Although some details remain to be clarified,
work on this RDF schema is largely complete, so the relator
list (with URIs for each entity) should be available shortly
after the DCMI Usage Board meeting of June 2003.</P>

<H4>4.1.1. MARC elements</H4>

<P>MARC 21 has different "formats" &#151; bibliographic, authority,
holdings, classification, and community information &#151;
so the URI must identify a particular element with respect
both to the MARC 21 namespace and to the particular format.
Using a namespace established for elements expressed as ISO
2709 or MARCXML as a base, URIs for MARC elements might be
constructed as follows:</P>

    <blockquote>
    <b class="blue">http://www.loc.gov/marc.[format]/[fieldname].[subfield]</b>
    </blockquote>

<P>For example:</P>
    
    <blockquote>
    <b class="blue">http://www.loc.gov/marc.bibliographic/245</b><br>
    <b class="blue">http://www.loc.gov/marc.bibliographic/245.a</b><br>
    <b class="blue">http://www.loc.gov/marc.bibliographic/008-s-03</b><br>
    <b class="blue">http://www.loc.gov/marc.authority/008</b>
    </blockquote>

<P>would identify (respectively) field 245 of the MARC
bibliographic format; subfield $a of field 245; sound recording
008 character position 03; and the 008 element of the MARC
authority format.</P>

<H4>4.1.2. MARC code lists</H4>

<P>The MARC Code List for Relators is a list of roles that
agents may assume with regard to a particular work, such as
"author", "translator", or "censor".  Each term on the Relators
list will be a assigned a URI of the following form:</P>

    <blockquote>
    <b class="blue">http://www.loc.gov/marc.relators/adp</b>
    </blockquote>

<P>where the last element is the code representing the relator
term &#151; in this case, "adp" for "adaptor".  At a later date,
this pattern &#151; appending a code to a namespace prefix &#151; would
be followed to construct URIs for values in other code lists.
The MARC language codes present a special case since they
are equivalent to codes in the ISO standard 639-2/B codes
and will therefore be considered at a later date.</P>

<H4>4.1.3. Source codes</H4>

<P>MARC 21 uses codes to identify the source of a value
(in Dublin Core terminology, these would be "encoding
schemes"). The DCMI Libraries Working Group has recommended
that certain sources be "registered" and given persistent
identity. Several of the encoding schemes registered for use
with Dublin Core elements will also exist in the MARC namespace
(such as "lcsh", which in both MARC and Dublin Core stands for
"Library of Congress Subject Headings"). If the Library of
Congress were to assign a URI to the MARC "lcsh" (to which
DCMI has already assigned a URI), then the mechanics and the
etiquette of cross-referencing and perhaps of establishing
a preference between the redundant identifiers would need to
be worked out &#151; an interesting test case for situations that
surely will arise in other contexts as well.</P>

<H4>4.1.4. MODS elements</H4>

<P>The namespace for MODS to be used as a prefix for URIs is</P>
    
    <blockquote>
    <b class="blue">http://www.loc.gov/mods</b>
    </blockquote>

<P>Some MODS elements are already used in the DCMI Library
Application Profile, so URI assignment for these would
be particularly useful.  For example, <b class="blue">Location</b> and
<b class="blue">Edition</b> might be identified as follows:</p>

<blockquote> 
    <b class="blue">http://www.loc.gov/mods/location</b><br>
    <b class="blue">http://www.loc.gov/mods/originInfo.edition</b>
    </blockquote>

<p>where <b class="blue">edition</b> is a sub-element of <b class="blue">originInfo</b>.

<H4>4.2. The longer term: URNs</H4>

<P>For the longer term, the Library of Congress plans
to explore the use of Uniform Resource Names (URNs) &#151;
a particular form of URI &#151; in the context of a more
comprehensive solution to the problem of identifying its
elements.  Compared to "http:" URIs, URNs are attractive for
use as persistent element identifiers because their primary
purpose is naming rather than resolution or retrieval.  URNs
for MARC and MODS elements could resemble the following:</P>

    <blockquote>
	<b class="blue">URN:[urn namespace id]:marc.bibliographic/245.a</b><br>
	<b class="blue">URN:[urn namespace id]:mods/originInfo.edition</b><br>
	<b class="blue">URN:[urn namespace id]:marc.relators/adp</b>
    </blockquote>

<H4>4.3. Identification of XML schemas</H4>

<P>The Library of Congress plans to register handles to be
used as persistent names for XML schemas it maintains. These
handles will be expressed as URLs that resolve through a
proxy server at the Library of Congress (http://hdl.loc.gov).
For example:</P>

    <blockquote>
	<b class="blue">http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.standards/mods</b><br>
	<b class="blue">http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.standards/marc21.slim</b>

<H3>5. UNIMARC</H3>

<P>UNIMARC ("UNIversal MAchine Readable Catalogue") is a family
of standards for bibliographic, authority, classification,
and item description of resources. Originally promoted
by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) to facilitate the exchange of records between national
variants of MARC, UNIMARC has until recently been maintained
in the context of IFLA's Universal Bibliographic Control and
International MARC Core Activity [UBCIM]. Since March 2003,
UNIMARC is maintained in a new UNIMARC Program hosted by
the National Library of Portugal, which endorsed the CORES
Resolution in June 2003.  As UNIMARC shares the same basic
model as MARC 21, the National Library of Portugal will
coordinate on an implementation of the CORES Resolution with
Library of Congress.</P>

<H3>6. CERIF</H3>

<P>The Common European Research Information Format (CERIF)
provides a set of guidelines for the exchange of data
about research projects along with information about
related researchers, organisations, funding programmes,
and publications [<a href="07baker.html#CERIF">CERIF</a>].  The format is intended for use
in building and managing a Current Research Information
System (CRIS).  Originally developed under the auspices
of the Innovation Directorate of the European Commission
in the late 1980s for use by member states of the European
Union, CERIF has been transferred to the custodianship of
EuroCRIS, a not-for-profit membership forum for individuals and
organisations concerned with the use of information technology
in the conduct of research information systems [<a href="07baker.html#EUROCRIS">EUROCRIS</a>].</P>

<H4>6.1 The CERIF data model</H4>

<P>The CERIF data model is defined in terms of entities,
attributes, and relationships.  There is a full CRIS
data model, used as a template for building a new CRIS or
as a blueprint for transforming a legacy CRIS; an exchange
data model used for the exchange of data between CRISes;
and a metadata data model used to describe a CRIS to a
portal providing homogeneous access over a heterogeneous,
distributed set of CRISes.  Each model is based on
entities (e.g.,  <b class="blue">&lt;Project&gt;</b>,
<b class="blue">&lt;Person&gt;</b>, <b
class="blue">&lt;OrgUnit&gt;</b>) with attributes
(e.g.,  <b class="blue">&lt;ProjectId&gt;</b>, <b
class="blue">&lt;Status&gt;</b>).  Some attributes are defined
as separate entities, such as <b class="blue">&lt;Title&gt;</b>
(to support language variants) and some attributes, such as
<b class="blue">&lt;Status&gt;</b>, must take their values from
an entity containing an enumerated list of valid values.</P>

<P>Entities (with their attributes) are linked by
relationships, which are themselves represented as
entities with attributes.  For example, the entity
<b class="blue">&lt;Project&gt;</b> can be linked by a
relationship to entity <b class="blue">&lt;Person&gt;</b>,
the relationship being expressed as an entity with
attributes <b class="blue">&lt;ProjectId&gt;</b>
(to link to <b class="blue">&lt;Project&gt;</b>),
<b class="blue">&lt;PersonId&gt;</b> (to
link to <b class="blue">&lt;Person&gt;</b>), <b
class="blue">&lt;Role&gt;</b> (role of the relationship
e.g., as project leader, project member, project reviewer),
<b class="blue">&lt;StartDateTime&gt;</b> (the start of the
relationship between <b class="blue">&lt;Project&gt;</b>
and <b class="blue">&lt;Person&gt;</b>), <b
class="blue">&lt;EndDateTime&gt;</b> (the end of the
relationship between <b class="blue">&lt;Project&gt;</b> and
<b class="blue">&lt;Person&gt;</b>).</P>

<H4>6.2 Assignment of URIs</H4>

<P>That the "elements" of CERIF (in terms of the CORES
Resolution) are embedded in a specific data-model context
needs to be reflected in the URIs used to identify them.  As of
June 2003, EuroCRIS had reached a working consensus on the URIs</P>

    <blockquote>
    <b class="blue">http://www.eurocris.org/cerif</b><br>
    <b class="blue">http://www.eurocris.org/cerif/model</b><br>        
    <b class="blue">http://www.eurocris.org/cerif/domainontology</b>
    </blockquote>

to identify and locate (respectively) CERIF as a whole, the
CERIF data model, and a structured ontology in which each
element is described formally &#151; i.e., machine-understandably
&#151; using DAML+OIL.  The latter two URIs are to be extensible
in the form 

    <blockquote>
    <b class="blue">&lt;entity&gt;</b>/<b class="blue">&lt;attribute&gt;</b>
    </blockquote>

<P>as with the following URIs for <b class="blue">&lt;Acronym&gt;</b>:</P>

    <blockquote>
    <b class="blue">http://www.eurocris.org/cerif/model/OrgUnit/Acronym</b><br>
    <b class="blue">http://www.eurocris.org/cerif/domainontology/OrgUnit/Acronym</b>
    </blockquote>

<P>which define <b class="blue">&lt;Acronym&gt;</b> (respectively)
both as an attribute of <b class="blue">&lt;OrgUnit&gt;</b>
(an Organisational Unit such as an Institute, Company,
or Department) and in terms of its relationships to other
attributes or elements in the context of the CERIF Domain
Ontology.</p>

<H4>6.3 Resolution of URIs</H4>

<P>At present, the EuroCRIS Web site is driven by a database,
such that no individual page is accessed directly with a URI.
EuroCRIS expects to use the URIs both as identifiers for
their "elements" and as locators of machine-understandable
resources.  The Domain Ontology, for example, would provide
a machine-understandable description of the entities,
attributes, and associated logic constraints in order to
ensure the integrity of the data model and the second URI
for <b class="blue">&lt;Acronym&gt;</b> (above) would serve
not just to identify the element with respect to the ontology
but to locate and retrieve machine-understandable code which
defines particular constraints on the element.</P>

<H4>6.4 Finalising a URI assignment policy</H4>

EuroCRIS is currently testing variations in
naming policy &#151; e.g., to choose between <b
class="blue">&lt;Result_Publication&gt;</b> and <b
class="blue">&lt;ResultPublication&gt;</b> and between the
following three variants:

    <blockquote>
    <b class="blue">http://www.eurocris.org/cerif/model/OrgUnit/Acronym</b><br>
    <b class="blue">http://www.eurocris.org/cerif/domainontology/#OrgUnit/#Acronym</b><br>
    <b class="blue">http://www.eurocris.org/cerif/domainontology/OrgUnit/#Acronym</b>
    </blockquote>

<P>Entities representing relationships may be named using
underscores, as with <b class="blue">&lt;Person_OrgUnit&gt;</b>.
The objective is to finalise a naming policy that most
closely fits with existing applications and with emerging
conventions for identifier syntax.  The URIs will be maintained
by EuroCRIS as long as EuroCRIS exists as an organisation,
and should EuroCRIS cease to exist, an attempt would be made
to transfer custodianship to another responsible body.</P>

<H3>7. IEEE/LOM</H3>

<P>Learning Object Metadata (LOM) is a standard for
facilitating the search, evaluation, acquisition, and use of
learning objects, for instance by learners or instructors. It
is based on work in the projects ARIADNE and IMS and builds
on work from the Dublin Core group [<a href="07baker.html#ARIADNE">ARIADNE</a>, <a href="07baker.html#IMS">IMS</a>].  The LOM data
elements describe a learning object and are grouped into
categories. The Base Scheme consists of nine such categories:
General, Lifecycle, Meta-metadata, Technical, Educational,
Rights, Relation, Annotation, and Classification.  The LOM
standard is maintained by the LOM Working Group of the Learning
Technology Standards Committee (LTSC) of the Institute for
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) [<a href="07baker.html#LOM-WG">LOM-WG</a>].</P>

<P>As of June 2003, the LOM Working Group is balloting a
specification for an XML binding of LOM, so a full account
of URI assignment policies would be premature.  However,
five sets of issues under discussion in the working group
can be presented in a general sense:</P>

<H4>7.1 Form of URIs</H4>

<P>The URI assignment policy should be extensible and should
be able to evolve nicely with the standard set of elements
to which it refers. In the case of LOM, this means considering
the following aspects:</P>

<P>Should the namespace reflect the basically hierarchical nature
of LOM?  In that case, URIs would be of the form

    <blockquote>
    <b class="blue">http://ltsc.ieee.org/LOM/General/Identifier</b><br>
    <b class="blue">http://ltsc.ieee.org/LOM/General/Title</b>
    </blockquote>

<P>However, this could be inappropriate for future versions,
as it seems to suggest that the hierarchical structure will
never be modified (for instance, by moving an element from one
category to another) or abandoned altogether (for instance,
to create a "flat space" of independent data elements. For
these reasons, it may be more appropriate to have a flat
namespace, as in</P>

    <blockquote>
    <b class="blue">http://ltsc.ieee.org/LOM/Identifier</b><br>
    <b class="blue">http://ltsc.ieee.org/LOM/Title</b>
    </blockquote>

<P>However, a flat namespace conflicts with current practice
for naming data elements in LOM, because data elements with an
identical name appear in different places in the base schema. 
For example</P>

    <blockquote>
    <b class="blue">General.Identifier</b> &#151; identifies the learning object
    <b class="blue">Meta-Metadata.Identifier</b> &#151; identifies the metadata record
    </blockquote>

<P>If both of these elements were referred to as</P>

    <blockquote>
    <b class="blue">http://ltsc.ieee.org/LOM/Identifier</b>
    </blockquote>

<P>then the (important!) distinction between them would seem
to be lost. Alternatively, then, one might refer to them as</P>

    <blockquote>
    <b class="blue">http://ltsc.ieee.org/LOM/GeneralIdentifier</b><br>
    <b class="blue">http://ltsc.ieee.org/LOM/MetadataIdentifier</b>
    </blockquote>

<P>but in this case, the labels from the standard base schema
conceptual definition would need to be adapted for the XML
binding.</P>

<H4>7.2 Representing versions in URIs</H4>

<P>How should information about a version of LOM be reflected in 
the URIs?  Two obvious candidates are</P>

    <blockquote>
    <b class="blue">http://ltsc.ieee.org/LOMv1.0/&lt;name_of_data_element&gt;</b><br>
    <b class="blue">http://ltsc.ieee.org/LOM/v1.0/&lt;name_of_data_element&gt;</b>
    </blockquote>

<P>However, an alternative could be</P>

    <blockquote>
    <b class="blue">http://ltsc.ieee.org/LOM/&lt;name_of_data_element&gt;/LOMv.10</b>
    </blockquote>

<P>This second approach seems to suggest a more independent
evolution over different versions for individual data
elements, whereas the earlier proposal seems to suggest a
more consolidated evolution of the LOM schema as a whole.</P>

<H4>7.3 Maintenance authority</H4>

<p>URIs need to be assigned in a way that is consistent across
an organisation. In the case of IEEE LTSC LOM, this begs
the question whether the relevant organisation is the IEEE,
the IEEE LTSC, or the IEEE LTSC LOM working group.  The more
general approach seems preferable, if only because it will
lead to consistency across a wide spectrum of standards, which
will decrease the learning time for developers that adopt
the standards. On the other hand, aiming at a comprehensive
consensus in the larger organisation implies a process that is
more complex and time-consuming.</P>

<H4>7.4 Relationship between URIs and schema bindings</H4>

<P>A variant on the previous issue is the question of
consistency of namespaces across different bindings of
the LOM. The LOM working group is currently working both
on a "straightforward" XML binding and on an RDF binding.
The latter is itself bound to XML. On the one hand, it seems
preferable to adopt the same URIs for the same LOM data
elements in both bindings. On the other hand, one could
question whether the data elements really are identical
across both bindings. This relates to the first issue
above, as RDF is more in line with a flat approach to URI
assignment, whereas an XML schema would be more compatible
with a hierarchical approach, as XML schemas essentially
define tree structures.</P>

<H4>7.5 Resolution of URIs</H4>

<P>Should the URIs resolve to something, and, if so, to
what? In principle, URIs need not resolve to anything if
they are intended merely as globally unique identifiers &#151;
in this context, for data elements. However, users who think
of URIs as URLs may click on them in their browsers, and if
this yields the error message "not found", they may genuinely
believe that a namespace is "broken".  Even more serious is
the fact that tools like XML parsers or anti-virus programs may
try to resolve the URIs in namespace declarations and signal a
"problem" when such a resolution fails.  This seems to suggest
that URIs should resolve to something. Some argue that they
should resolve to a document putting the metadata elements
into a context.  Others argue that URIs should resolve to
XML DTDs or Schemas, so that software tools can read the
"definition" of the namespace.</P>

<P>Deciding on a long-term approach for URI assignment is not
a trivial matter and will require further discussion in the LOM
Working Group during the ballot for the XML binding and beyond.</P>

<H3>8. Dublin Core</H3>

<P>The Dublin Core is a set of fifteen generic metadata
elements for discovering resources across a diversity of
domains and languages.  Developed in the mid-1990s by a
mixture of librarians and computer scientists, the early
workshops overlapped with efforts to clarify an architecture
and data model for metadata in the Web more generally &#151;
efforts that led to the mutually influential development
of Resource Description Framework (RDF).  The Dublin Core,
along with related sets of metadata terms and technical
specifications, is currently maintained by the Dublin Core
Metadata Initiative, an open forum for the development of
interoperable metadata solutions hosted on a not-for-profit
basis by the Online Computer Library System in Dublin, Ohio
[<a href="07baker.html#DCMI">DCMI</a>].  The key specification for the Dublin Core has been
formally endorsed as ISO 15836-2003 [<a href="07baker.html#DC-ISO">DC-ISO</a>].</P>

<H4>8.1 URI assignment methods</H4>

<P>The identification of DCMI metadata terms with URIs is 
governed by a Namespace Policy [<a href="07baker.html#DCMI-NAMESPACE">DCMI-NAMESPACE</a>].  This policy
currently declares URIs for three DCMI namespaces:</P>
    
    <blockquote>
    <b class="blue">http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/</b><br>
    <b class="blue">http://purl.org/dc/terms/</b><br>
    <b class="blue">http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/</b>
    </blockquote>

<P>designating (respectively) the fifteen-element Dublin
Core, all other DCMI elements and qualifiers, and a
controlled vocabulary of values for the Dublin Core element
<b class="blue">Type</b>.  The URI for each DCMI term is constructed by 
appending the term name to the URI of a DCMI namespace.
For example:</P>

<blockquote>
    <b class="blue">http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title</b><br>
    <b class="blue">http://purl.org/dc/terms/extent</b><br>
    <b class="blue">http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Image</b>
    </blockquote>

<P>identify <b class="blue">title</b> (an element in the Dublin Core),
<b class="blue">extent</b> (a "qualifier" term), and <b class="blue">Image</b> (in the
DCMI Type Vocabulary).  A persistence policy commits DCMI to
the maintenance of formal documentation, over time, for any
URIs so assigned.</P>

<H4>8.2 Information conveyed in URI strings</H4>

<P>Two significant issues were raised during the development of
this policy.  Firstly, it was suggested that DCMI namespace
URIs indicate a <em>category</em> of DCMI terms identified
therein.  For example, it was proposed that different
DCMI namespaces be used to partition DCMI elements from
DCMI qualifiers, or to indicate that a particular term was
originally defined by a particular working group or within a
particular domain.  Secondly, it was suggested that all DCMI
namespace URIs carry versioning information (for example
a date stamp) that would be updated as terms within the
namespace change.</P>

<P>On the first issue, it was considered that the category of
a DCMI term is not necessarily persistent.  For example, terms
defined initially by the education community might subsequently
become useful to other communities.  Associating particular
URIs with particular categories of terms was not felt to be
helpful to the long-term stability of DCMI namespaces or the
URIs of DCMI terms within those namespaces.</P>

<P>On the second issue it was again considered that
embedding versioning information within the namespace
URI was unlikely to be helpful to the long-term stability
of DCMI namespaces or the URIs of DCMI terms within those
namespaces.  Rather, it was felt that versioning information
should be carried in the formal documentation of the terms.
The one exception to this rule, the DCMI namespace <b
class="blue">http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/</b>, was maintained
because it was already in wide use when the Namespace Policy was finished.</P>

<H4>8.3 Editorial changes to URI-identified terms</H4>

<P>As an alternative to reflecting version changes in URIs,
the Namespace Policy articulates the implications for URI
identification of various classes of editorial changes to
term declarations, whereby "minor" or "substantive" errata
may be corrected without consequence for URIs while changes
of a semantic nature trigger the creation of a new term
(and corresponding URI).</P>

<H4>8.4 Resolution of URIs</H4>

<P>The Namespace Policy specifies that all of the URIs
identifying DCMI terms "will resolve to a machine-processable
DCMI term declaration for all the terms within that namespace".
As of June 2003, DCMI term URIs redirect to an RDF schema
documenting that term's DCMI namespace, but the formulation
in the Namespace Policy is sufficiently vague as to support
any future conventions for formal representation or content
negotiation that might emerge [<a href="07baker.html#DC-RDF">DC-RDF</a>].</P>

<H4>8.5 Practicalities and etiquette of recognising non-DCMI URIs</H4>

<P>From the beginning, Dublin Core has defined itself as
a small standard with broad applicability, and much of the
effort in DCMI has gone towards clarifying how the core and
its various extensions can be used together with more detailed
or domain-specific vocabularies declared and maintained by
specialised communities of expertise.  The DCMI Usage Board has
shown a bias towards keeping the core standard small through
cooperation with maintainers of more specialised standards
on forms of mutual recognition and support.  As discussed in
Section 4 above, DCMI is currently working with the Library
of Congress on the mechanics of formally expressing that the
MARC relator terms semantically refine the Dublin Core element
<b class="blue">contributor</b>.</P>

<H3>9. Towards forms of good practice</H3>

<P>An Accompanying Measure under the Semantic Web call of the
Information Society Technologies programme, the CORES Project
was motivated in part by a desire to promote the development
of metadata practice in support of W3C's vision of a Semantic
Web, and in laying the groundwork for the Brussels meeting,
the project greatly benefited from the technical advice of
W3C's Semantic Web Activity.  Although the meeting confirmed
that some standards communities are focused more strongly
on organising information within specific communities and
applications than on the grander context of a global Web,
the fact that such a diverse group of standards communities
could find common ground with a technology fundamental to Web
architecture should be supportive of that broader vision
as well.</P>

<P>In the six months since the signing of the CORES Resolution,
the signatories have worked towards translating their
commitments into practical URI assignment and persistence
policies.  Given the need to evaluate the impact of design
decisions and to build consensus in the communities behind
the standards, it was perhaps too ambitious to expect that
policies could be finalised and URIs assigned within just
thirty-six weeks.  However, having such a short fuse for such
a specific set of tasks has highlighted a number of areas
where forms of good practice have yet to emerge.</P>
<H4>9.1 What to identify</H4>

<P>Beyond mandating the assignment of URIs to "elements", the
Resolution left it up to the signatories to decide exactly
what that means in the context of a particular standard and
which other entities, such as sets of elements or values
in controlled vocabularies, should also be so identified.
Some interesting questions have arisen in this regard:</P>

<UL>
    <LI>Should the URI of an element reflect a hierarchical
    context within which it is embedded?  In IEEE/LOM,
    for example, a learning object and the metadata record
    about that learning object each have an identifier.
    Should <b class="blue">GeneralIdentifier</b> and <b
    class="blue">MetadataIdentifier</b> be assigned separate URIs
    to express this distinction, or just one?</LI></UL>

  <UL><LI>If organisation A creates a URI designating an
    entity maintained by organisation B, and organisation
    B then creates its own URI for the same entity, by what
    etiquette or mechanism can the redundant identifiers be
    cross-referenced or preferences declared?  For example,
    DCMI has assigned a URI to a term used for indicating
    that a given value was taken from the Library of Congress
    Subject Headings, but the Library of Congress will now
    assign its own URI to designate the same vocabulary.</LI></UL>

    <UL><LI>If semantically identical elements are shared across
    multiple element sets maintained by an organisation,
    should they each be assigned a separate URI or share one
    common URI?  For example, MARC 21 and MODS share the concept
    "name", though one standard identifies the concept with
    a number while the other uses a word, leading to the formation
    of two separate URIs.</LI></UL>

    <UL><LI>All participants recognize that metadata elements
    may evolve over time, but for several signatories the
    implications of that change for URI assignment were
    as yet unclear.  The question is whether successive
    historical versions of an element should share a single,
    unchanging URI or whether each version should be assigned
    its own URI, perhaps by embedding a version number in
    the URI string.</LI>

</UL>

<H4>9.2 What URIs should resolve to</H4>

<P>The Resolution leaves it to the signatory organizations
what the URIs should look like and explicitly says that no
assumptions should be made that URIs resolve to something on
the Web.  Aside from the International DOI Foundation, which has proposed the URI
scheme "doi:", and Library of Congress, which is exploring the
use of URNs for the long term, the signatories have assigned or
propose to assign URIs beginning with the URI scheme "http:".
Using URIs (identifier strings) that look exactly like URLs
(addresses for retrieving something from the Web) inevitably
raises the problem of resolution. Users who click on a URI
and get "Error: Not Found" may think the URI is broken.  As a
longer-term solution to the problem of naming, the Library
of Congress will be investigating the use of URNs, which do
not entail such an expectation.  The "doi:" scheme is to be
associated with a particular set of resolution, conversion,
and retrieval services.</P>

<H4>9.3 Asserting semantic relationships</H4>

<P>The Resolution is silent about how the URIs assigned
can be used in asserting semantic relationships between
elements in different sets.  URIs were seen as a useful
common basis for asserting the relationship of elements in
a diversity of applications to shared ontologies such as the
Basic Semantic Register or the &lt;in<em>d</em>ecs&gt; <em>Data Dictionary</em>, or to
formally express the relationship between two element sets in
the machine-processable and re-usable form of an RDF schema.
Facilitating the expression and processing of such assertions
in the interest of interoperability between different forms
of metadata was seen by its signatories as the longer-term
significance of the CORES Resolution.</P>
