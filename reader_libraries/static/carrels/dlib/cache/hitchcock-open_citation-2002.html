<p class="blue">The speed of scientific communication &#151; the rate of ideas affecting other

researchers' ideas &#151; is increasing dramatically. The factor driving this

is free, unrestricted access to research papers. Measurements of user

activity in mature eprint archives of research papers such as arXiv have

shown, for the first time, the degree to which such services support an

evolving network of texts commenting on, citing, classifying, abstracting,

listing and revising other texts. The Open Citation project has built tools

to measure this activity, to build new archives, and has been closely involved

with the development of the infrastructure to support open access on which

these new services depend. This is the story of the project, intertwined

with the concurrent emergence of the Open Archives Initiative (OAI). The

paper describes the broad scope of the project's work, showing how it has

progressed from early demonstrators of reference linking to produce Citebase,

a Web-based citation and impact-ranked search service, and how it has supported the

development of the EPrints.org software for  building OAI-compliant archives. The

work has been underpinned by analysis and experiments on the semantics

of documents (digital objects) to determine the features required for formally

perfect linking &#151; instantiated as an application programming interface

(API) for reference linking &#151; that will enable other applications to build

on this work in broader digital library information environments.</p>

<H3>Introduction: Exploiting Open Access</H3>


        
<p>Imagine, as a researcher, the prospect of free, instant access, at any

time, anywhere, to all peer reviewed papers and data that might affect

your work. How much better would that be than the present situation? Such a prospect is 

achievable through the process of authors self-archiving their eprint papers

in open-access archives that comply with the Open Archives Initiative (OAI).</p>

<p>The power of this idea is permeating the scholarly publishing establishment.

More libraries are beginning to host OAI-based open-access archives to

present research papers produced by their institutions (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Crow">Crow 2002</a>). Progressive

publishers are providing free online versions of journals, sometimes before,

sometimes after, formal publication; new business models for open access

journals are at last emerging. Even those that remain unconvinced by open

access recognise the move to electronic publication must be accompanied

by improved access. Publishers are collaborating as never before, among

themselves and with digital libraries, to support new electronic services

such as reference linking and mediated access based on powerful databases

and new systems of identifiers and rights management. It's a serious business.

In fact, only one group in the scholarly communication chain isn't yet

embracing open access as much as it ought: authors (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Pinfield">Pinfield 2002</a>).</p>

<p>This is curious, because authors stand to gain most in the switch to

open access. Some fear damaging prestigious peer reviewed journals, but

as is already apparent, journals are getting better because open access

and self-archiving do not exclude other forms of publication and, focused

by competition, journals will enhance their core values.
</p>

<p>Authors are well aware of the potential benefits of open access, but

how can they be persuaded to act in pursuit of these benefits? The key

requirements that scholarly authors demand of publication are visibility

and impact. The key to determining impact is the ability to measure citations.</p>

<p>The Open Citation Project grew out of an early demonstration of tools

to add links, post-authoring, to references contained in scholarly papers

in Web-deliverable formats. The basic idea was to extend the application

to very large numbers of papers freely available on the Web. Linking on

that scale would require automatic recognition and collection of references

contained in these papers. If the references are stored in a database,

it is possible to do more than link references: for a given paper, the

number of times it has been referenced can be determined, and from this

emerges the ability to measure impact.</p>

<p>There is nothing new in this, except that impact has always been associated

with journals and has typically been measured by expensive secondary services.

Could it be possible that papers freely available on the Web might also

have a measurable impact? And might this measurement be provided by a service

that, like the papers it acts on, is free and could give authors (and research

assessment agencies) an instant indication of the impact of their papers

(<a href="10hitchcock.html#Harnad2001">Harnad 2001</a>)?</p>

<p>This is the story of the Open Citation Project, intertwined with the

concurrent emergence of the OAI, which has become a focal point for open

access to metadata describing all sorts of digital objects held by libraries

hosting Open Archives. Open access, Open Archives, reference linking and

citation analysis are all connected, we contend, in creating a managed

digital library framework in which peer reviewed scholarly papers can be

made freely accessible to all in the most efficient manner possible.</p>

<p>The story begins with the transition from backwards-in-time reference

linking to forward-in-time citation analysis on the Web, and the consequent

potential to transform open access. While once there may have been wild projections

for open access, the scenarios described above, involving publishers and

libraries, are real and are an integral part of this story.</p>

<H3>
From Reference Linking to Citation Analysis on the Web</H3>

<p>Reference linking has become the <em>de facto</em> added value for electronic

journals (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Hunter">Hunter 1998</a>). In recent years there have been important reference

linking initiatives. Journal publishers have converged on Digital Object

Identifiers (DOIs) and CrossRef (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Pentz">Pentz 2001</a>), described by Hellman (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Hellman">Hellman 2001</a>)

as a 'miracle'. The library community, which wants to solve the perennial

'appropriate copy' problem &#151; getting the right resource to the right user

at the right time &#151; for the digital world (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Caplan">Caplan and Flecker 1999</a>), appears

to have selected the ingenious OpenURL (<a href="10hitchcock.html#VandeSompel2001">Van de Sompel and Beit-Arie 2001</a>),

a proposal for 'context-sensitive' linking (i.e., a service that knows which

resources are available to a user) currently being fast-tracked towards

standardisation by NISO.</p>

<p>Web linking is not easy and raises social and cultural problems, for example,

the misunderstanding of, and resistance to, deep linking by some commercial Web content providers. Reference linking similarly raises commercial

as well as technical issues (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Hitchcock1998b">Hitchcock et al. 1998b</a>). Hellman referred to the 'unprecedented' cooperation between all the major science

publishers through CrossRef, rather than to any implementation, but tensions

remain (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Quint">Quint 2002</a>). Demonstration systems embracing these various linking

components have raised hopes that heterogeneous and diverse information

environments can be viewed by users as though they are a single delivery

system (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Beit-Arie">Beit-Arie

et al. 2001</a>), although some remain skeptical (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Pace">Pace

2002</a>).</p>

<p>From the user perspective, reference links are remarkably useful, but

in essence all the link does is save the user time. A formal reference

given in a paper is an address to the cited work. Even without the link

the referenced work ought to be retrievable. A link might save the user

minutes or even weeks in retrieving the work &#151; currently we can only speculate

on the cognitive impact on scholarly research of instant and universal

online retrievability, which Harnad calls 'scholarly skywriting' and which

he predicts will 'increase individual scholars' productivity by an order

of magnitude' (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Harnad1996">Harnad 1996</a>).</p>

<p>The real value in collected reference data is not in producing links

that point to works in the past, the authored links, but in creating links

that transport the user forward in time. For a given paper, what later

works have cited it? Unlike the reference list, this cannot be an authored

part of the original paper and cannot be determined by the reader independently.

Citation analysis requires an additional service. It is possible to build

a simple citation database by storing bibliographic records that contain

the reference lists from papers. Hundreds of thousands of users of citation

manager programs such as EndNote and ProCite recognise the utility of citation

analysis for building personalised bibliographies (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Simboli">Simboli and Zhang 2002</a>).</p>
<p>Citation analysis is not new. The technique was first identified by

Garfield and has since been exploited in information products from ISI,

the company that Garfield formed. Garfield's brilliant insight was to recognise

that references in journal papers can be used to form an intellectual index

across the whole of a chosen literature. Such an index would be impossibly

complex and costly to compile without author references: "by using authors'

references in compiling the citation index, we are in reality utilizing

an army of indexers" (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Garfield1955">Garfield 1955</a>).</p>

<p>More than that, the index can be used to measure the 'impact' of cited

works. The more often a paper is cited, the more highly regarded the work

is likely to be within the peer community. This factor has become a widely

used, if contentious, measure of the importance of papers, authors and

journals. This knowledge can in turn can be used by scholars new to a field

to find starting points for exploring the literature.</p>

<p>ISI has found a lucrative market for its products, indicating the high

value that the research community places on tools that measure citation

impact. Other abstract and indexing database services, such as the
the American Chemical Society's Chemical Abstracts Service and American
Mathematical Society's MathSciNet, have belatedly noticed the potential of 
including citing reference lists. Citation links have also crept into 
papers in the electronic versions of high-profile journals such as Science 
and Nature, drawing on secondary sources such as ISI. (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Simboli">Simboli and Zhang 2002</a>).</p>

<p>The advent of the Web has brought dramatic growth in the availability of

journal papers online, many free of charge through services such as arXiv (<a href="10hitchcock.html#ArXiv">ArXiv</a>),

and has opened new possibilities for citation analysis. With network access

to works, it becomes possible to automate data collection from very large

resources at relatively low cost, making it feasible for Web-based citation

services to be offered free to users. NEC's ResearchIndex (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Lawrence1999">Lawrence et al. 1999</a>), CERN's Document Server (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Claivaz">Claivaz et al. 2001</a>) and Citebase, a citation and impact-ranked search service

produced by the Open Citation Project, are examples. In contrast to

ISI's established subscription services covering a self-selecting corpus

of 6500 of the highest impact journals, ResearchIndex and Citebase are in

their infancy, covering diverse collections, having to work with inconsistent data formats, and trying to identify user preferences to optimise their features. Progress is being made. ResearchIndex (<a href="10hitchcock.html#ResearchIndex">ResearchIndex</a>)

currently indexes over a million computer science papers. Citebase is linked

from over 200,000 arXiv records (currently on a trial basis), introducing

the service to tens of thousands of prospective users.</p>

<p>ArXiv links to Citebase appear below links to the Stanford Linear Accelerator

Center (SLAC) SPIRES citation database in a typical abstract page (see

foot of Figure 1). The SLAC-SPIRES service involves more manual labour

in data collection and checking than the software approach of Citebase,

and SLAC-SPIRES has been compiled over a longer period &#151; since 1974 (<a href="10hitchcock.html#OConnell">O'Connell 2000</a>).

SLAC-SPIRES covers only high-energy physics, a large subset of arXiv, whereas

Citebase indexes all papers in arXiv. The two are thus not directly comparable,

but both emphasise the contentious nature of citation data with prominent

warnings about coverage and interpretation.</p>

<p>The Open Journal (OJ) Project produced some of the first demonstrators

of Web-based reference linking and citation analysis, but depended on data

supplied from journal publishers and ISI (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Hitchcock1998a">Hitchcock, et al. 1998a</a>).

Soon after this collaboration, ISI introduced <em>Web of Science</em>, making

its citation indexes available on the Web for the first time (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Atkins">Atkins 1999</a>).

Starting in 1999, as the successor to the OJ project, the three-year Open

Citation Project aimed to apply the tools and techniques from the earlier

OJ work to open and freely accessible Web data, in particular to now mature

eprint archives such as arXiv. The project combined the experience of reference

linking specialists in Southampton University's IAM group with the expertise

of digital library data management of the Digital Library Research Group

at Cornell University. The third partner was arXiv, then based at Los Alamos

and now hosted at Cornell.</p>

<p>As the Open Citation (OpCit) Project completes its funding period, this article 

describes the broad scope of its work, showing how it has progressed from

early demonstrators of reference linking to produce Citebase. This work

was underpinned by analysis and experiments on the semantics of documents

(digital objects) to determine the features required for formally perfect

linking: an application programming interface (API) for reference linking.

Along the route the project helped launch the OAI, with project principals

leading the development of metadata and protocol schemes on which OAI is

founded (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Lagoze">Lagoze and Van de Sompel 2001</a>). The project also supported the development

of EPrints.org software to build OAI-compliant archives.</p>

<H4>Reference linking: OpCit in the digital library environment</h4>

<p>One original objective of the Open Citation Project, described by Hitchcock

<em>et

al</em>. (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Hitchcock2000">Hitchcock 2000</a>), was to 'hyperlink', or produce reference links, for all

the papers in the arXiv physics archives. The extension of that work to

a build a citation database could be seen to be one of the primary contributors

to the objective of promoting this new way of navigating the scientific

journal literature based on free access and free services.</p>

<p>At that time OAI was in its infancy. In terms of numbers of papers,

access to eprints was, and still is, dominated by the centralised disciplinary-based

arXiv. OAI instead decided to focus attention and responsibility on institutions

for building and managing repositories, including eprint archives. Institutions

&#151; not disciplines or learned societies &#151; share with their authors the benefits

of enhanced usage and impact for their research output. To ensure the visibility

of archive contents is not limited to institutions, the other key aspect

of OAI is interoperability. If objects in an Open Archive are described

by a defined protocol and metadata format, then the presence or availability

of a work can be advertised to other, independent services. OAI based its

model and technical infrastructure on NCSTRL (Networked Computer Science

Technical Reference Library), which provided an index &#151; now being revived

within an OAI framework (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Anan">Anan et al. 2002</a>) &#151; for browsing and searching

papers from distributed collections made available by participating computer

science departments.</p>

<p>Thus, at the outset the project could foresee an information environment

based on distributed, interoperable institutional archives in which digital

libraries are distinguished by services that apply to various types of

content. Mediating services would provide managed and enhanced access to

free content (OpCit) or paid-for content (the established journal secondary

services supplemented by CrossRef and DOIs) or, in some cases, both (resolver

services such as SFX (<a href="10hitchcock.html#VandeSompel1999">Van de Sompel and Hochstenbach 1999</a>). OpenURL was

motivated by the need to standardise the way metadata describing cited

resources is packaged within a URL so this information can be passed to

resolvers such as SFX).</p>

<p>There are two ways of presenting digital services to users. One is to

modify the original content. An example is the project's early experiments

with reference linking, illustrated by Hitchcock et al. (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Hitchcock2000">Hitchcock 2000</a>).

References were linked, indicated by boxes surrounding the linked text,

from PDF versions of original papers. Overlaying services on content in

this way is effective if it is offered at the place and moment the user

needs it most. Otherwise this approach can appear intrusive and faces cultural

resistance. Further, it can be difficult, not to say inappropriate, to

add new information to the originally authored text. A more universally

accepted way is to create information interfaces.</p>

<H4>Citebase: a new interface to the scholarly literature</H4>

<p>As the volume of networked metadata and content grows, interfaces become

a powerful and flexible means of enabling users to explore this content.

Interfaces in the digital environment are analogous to packaging in the

physical world, embracing selection as well as access. What makes digital

services, and digital libraries, so powerful is the degree of automation

that can be implemented behind the user interface (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Arms">Arms 2000</a>). At its most

effective, this processing must be transparent yet responsive to user demands,

providing scope for user input and, for more advanced services, control.

The resulting output must be organised optimally for user response.</p>

<p>Search is the most familiar service on the Web, yet because most search

engines compete to offer the most comprehensive coverage of the Web, the

concept of selection is not immediately obvious. Instead, bare search services

that have not evolved into portals are characterised by a simple user interface

&#151; a text box &#151; and compete on the ability to provide fast processing and

the most relevant results. In other words, the most successful search engines

provide the desired result with minimal input and effort from the user

by delegating almost all choices and almost the entire task to a highly

sophisticated underlying algorithm and processor.</p>

<p>In one case the underlying algorithm provides citation analysis with

perhaps the ultimate accolade: a mass audience service, although it is

unlikely many users are aware of the connection with citation analysis.

The search service in question is Google, inevitably. Google has become

enormously popular for the quality of its results &#151; the ability to rank, at the top of the results, Web pages that satisfy the user's query (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Brin">Brin

and Page 1998</a>). As well as indexing content, Google analyses links <em>to</em>

Web pages. The technique works because links, like citations, are not offered

lightly and represent intellectual connections between works. The number

of links pointing to a page can be used to determine its relative importance

among pages on similar topics and is the basis of Google's ranked results.</p>

<p>The growth of OAI archives has motivated new search services, such as

Arc (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Arc">Arc</a>) (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Liu">Liu et al. 2001</a>) and OAIster (<a href="10hitchcock.html#OAIster">OAIster</a>),

which cover all registered OAI-compliant data providers (DPs) rather than

the Web (most OAI data providers are hidden to Web search engines, although

software such as DP9 (<a href="10hitchcock.html#DP9">DP9</a>) can be used

to build a gateway service for crawlers that require persistent URLs and

HTML rather than XML for all OAI records). These services harvest and store

OAI metadata records from OAI archives, so user search is based on these

data rather than the data of the complete archived objects.</p>

<p>Citebase &#151; designed to be a "Google for the refereed research literature" 
because it ranks research results, in this case based on authored 
references to designated papers, not on Web links as Google does &#151; exercises more selective coverage

(<a href="10hitchcock.html#Citebase">Citebase</a>). Data are harvested from the

larger OAI disciplinary archives &#151; currently arXiv, CogPrints (<a href="10hitchcock.html#CogPrints">CogPrints</a>)

and BioMed Central (<a href="10hitchcock.html#BioMed">BioMed</a>) &#151; that (with permission)

allow texts as well as metadata to be downloaded via an automated machine

interface. Unlike the earlier OpCit reference linking demonstrator, Citebase

does not store full documents but extracts the references, which are associated with the OAI metadata record for the document in which they are identified. 
This association between document records and references is the basis for
a classic citation database, matching a cited document with the record
for that document (reference linking) and matching a record with instances
of its citation (forward citation analysis), i.e.:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Document A cites document C</li>

<li>
Document B cites document C</li>
<li>
--&gt; Document C is cited by documents A and B</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, the citation database explicitly contains records for documents

A and B. A record can be treated as a surrogate for the full text because

it contains a direction (typically a URL) to the text. Although the existence

of document C is known through its citation by A and B, it may not be possible

to link to C if there is no harvested record for it. Whether C is known

simply by citation or as a harvested record, it will always be possible

to link from a citation of C to A and B, illustrating another benefit of

linking forward in time to citing documents.</p>

<p>The Citebase Web interface (Figure 2) shows how the user can classify

the search query terms (typical of an advanced search interface) based

on metadata in the harvested record (title, author, publication, date).

In separate interfaces, users can search by archive identifier or by citation.

What differentiates Citebase is that it also allows users to select the

criterion for ranking results by Citebase processed data (citation impact,

author impact) or based on terms in the records identified by the search,

e.g., date (see drop-down list in Figure 2). It is also possible to rank

results by the number of 'hits', a measure of the number of downloads and

therefore a rough measure of the usage of a paper. This is an experimental

feature to analyse both the quantitative and the temporal relationship

between hit (i.e., usage) and citation data, as measures of impact. Hits

are currently based on limited data from download frequencies at the UK

arXiv mirror at Southampton only. The further use and interpretation of

such data in the full Citebase service will be subject to further analysis

and discussion.</p>

<p>Co-cited articles are articles that have been referred to in the same citing

article. Where articles are co-cited many times (i.e., many articles cite

both), the number of times can be summed to provide a co-cited score. Co-cited

articles are likely to cover the same topic or argument, with the higher

the number of co-citations, the more likely the articles are closely related.</p>

<p>Citebase is based on classic citation principles adopted by other

successful services and widely used in the community, but does this implementation

work for users? There are a number of variables that need to be tested,

and Citebase has been evaluated by arXiv users and by others who use or

maintain bibliographic services to access the refereed journal literature.

Results of that evaluation are being processed and will be reported first

on the project Web site (<a href="10hitchcock.html#OpCit-p">OpCit Project</a>).</p>

<p>The aims of the evaluation were to:</p>

<ul>

<li>

Discover the user's awareness of related services</li>



<li>

Assess usability with a practical exercise</li>



<li>

Invite the user's views on the main features</li>



<li>

Assess the level of user satisfaction with the service</li>

</ul>

<p>Development of Citebase will continue beyond the OpCit project. Of widest

significance is the emergence of Citebase as a data provider as well as

an OAI service provider. Citebase records will be available to automated

harvesters just as though they were OAI records, although they are more

complex and contain reference data (Figure 3). Researchers at Old Dominion

University have harvested Citebase data as part of their Archon (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Archon">Archon</a>)

federated digital library on physics (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Liu2002">Liu et al. 2002</a>), and arXiv

is a possible (re)harvester of Citebase data too.</p>

<p>Experiments are being performed with various metadata formats and XML

schema for exporting reference data. One format designed for this purpose

is the Academic Metadata Format (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Krichel">Krichel and Warner 2001</a>). This is a 'local

profile', i.e., nonstandard, format. Other possibilities are encoding citations

in the OpenURL format, or using the structured-value set containing the

sub-elements for citation proposed by the Dublin Core Citation Working

Group (<a href="10hitchcock.html#DublinCore">Dublin Core</a>), which can be mapped

to OpenURL attributes (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Powell">Powell and Apps 2001</a>). The difficulties of producing

an agreed schema and format for citation metadata was highlighted on the

OAI-implementers discussion list (<a href="10hitchcock.html#OAI-implementers">OAI-implementers</a>),

thread XSD file for qualified DC).</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3. Example Citebase record encoded in DC-Citation-like format

for potential re-harvesting by other service and data providers</strong></p></center>

<p>Other planned enhancements include making Citebase reference links OpenURL-enabled, so pointing the links at library and journal services. This feature is

being investigated by directing OpenURL links at a target resolver service.

(Typically users should be able to select their preferred resolver, likely

to be based in their institutional library.) In this case, the target resolver

should ideally include Citebase data, so results presented to the user

following a Citebase link might include a link back to Citebase as well

as to other sources that might contain a referenced item. Citebase is a

new, non-commercial service and so is unlikely to be included in resolvers

supplied as part of library information systems (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Hellman">Hellman 2001</a>).</p>

<p>Citebase has a DP9 interface, principally to enable it to be indexed

by Google and other Web search engines. It has been discovered that this

needs to be optimised to enable Google to index the whole of Citebase:

it is believed Google takes longer to index dynamically generated cgi-based

services than static pages. This limited coverage of Citebase in Google

has become less important now that arXiv is indexed by the search service

(arXiv has had a long-standing policy blocking access to Web crawling software

used by search engines), and now that Citebase is linked from records for

arXiv papers. Ironically, the static arXiv links should ensure that Google

indexes all of Citebase. Other OAI data and service providers may still

need DP9 to assist indexing by Web search engines.</p>


<H3>API for Reference Linking</H3>

<p>There are many different applications for reference linking. The project

at Cornell considered the question "what would be the ideal behavior of

a digital object that supported reference linking (both incoming and outgoing)"?

Answering this question led to an API with four principal methods:</p>

<ol>

<li>

getMyData() - the digital object should emit standard metadata describing

that object, i.e., title, authors, year of publication, etc. in Dublin Core

format.</li>

</ol>




<ol start="2">

<li>

getReferenceList() - the digital object should say what its list of references

is (this is the fixed number of references contained in the online document).</li></ol>


<ol start="3">

<li>

getCitationList() - the object can say what other works the object knows

have cited it. (This list grows as more and more items are analyzed.)</li>

</ol>




<ol start="4">

<li>

getLinkedText() - returns the original content of the digital object but

with link information added to it so that each reference can be used to

go directly to an online copy of the referenced work, if an online copy

is available. </li>

</ol>

<p>Each component produced by these methods can be seen in a typical Citebase

record, but this approach is more generalisable to other reference linking

applications than that used to build Citebase.</p>

<p>A few Java classes were defined to support reference linking in an object

oriented way. These methods can be invoked on the surrogate, a special

class in the API that encapsulates data regarding a particular online digital

object. To use the API, a new surrogate is instantiated, passing it the

URL of the online digital object for which information is to be gathered.

Below is an example of a small Java program that uses the API to print

out the references from an online journal article.</p>

<pre>// A program that prints out the References from an on-line article

import <strong>Linkable.API.Surrogate</strong>;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // The API

public class PrintRef {

&nbsp;&nbsp; public static void main (String[] args) {

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // create a Surrogate for ths given URL (parses the HTML)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Surrogate s =&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new Surrogate (</strong>"http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may00/rudner/05rudner.html"<strong>)</strong>;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; String rl = new String(<strong>s.getReferenceList()</strong>);

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println(rl);

&nbsp;&nbsp; }

}</pre>

<p>The bulk of the analysis is done by the surrogate constructor, the single

line,

<tt>Surrogate s = new Surrogate(...);

</tt>This call downloads the

online work, turns it into XHTML, parses the XHTML, and extracts some information,

such as citations and references. The next call on the API, <tt>String

rl = new String(s.getReferenceList())</tt> invokes the method that returns

the references in the form of an XML document, which is then converted

to a String and printed. The API is downloadable from the Cornell project

site (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Reference-linking">Reference Linking API</a>).</p>

<p>It is anticipated that repositories will at some point contain reference

linking data, so the API was later extended to support persistent storage

of surrogates. Once a surrogate is instantiated, it can be saved to a repository,

if desired. Thus one could build a repository of surrogates, which could

later be re-instantiated and have the basic API methods invoked on them.

(A second version of the surrogate constructor was written to resurrect

saved surrogates.)</p>

<H4>API evaluation</h4>

<p>The API was used to build several applications against online journals

(<em>D-Lib Magazine</em>, <em>Journal of Electronic Publishing</em>, ACM Digital

Library). With five methods (the original four, plus save) the API was

found in our evaluations to be sufficiently usable. The main limitation

of the software is that not all HTML pages are equally easy to analyse,

e.g., some HTML is so badly written that it cannot be converted into XHTML

and, therefore, cannot be parsed. This is likely to remain a problem on the

Web for some time. A more complete description of the reference linking

API and its evaluation, including the <em>D-Lib</em> application, can be

found in Bergmark and Lagoze (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Bergmark2001">Bergmark and Lagoze 2001</a>). Also, a discussion of problems involved

with the extraction of reference linking data is detailed by Bergmark (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Bergmark2000">Bergmark 2000</a>).
</p>

<H4>RefLinking demonstrator</H4>

<p>A working application of the API turns HTML references in an online paper

into live links that will fetch the referenced item. This demonstrator

can be run from &lt;<a href="http://cs-tr.cs.cornell.edu/RefLinkingDemo">http://cs-tr.cs.cornell.edu/RefLinkingDemo</a>&gt;.

Using a Javascript-enabled browser, download the version of the paper with

"&lt;reflink&gt; elements converted into JavaScript code by an XSLT stylesheet"

(version 3 in the demonstrator), and try clicking on some references in

the linked text (a dialogue box should appear, allowing the referenced

paper to be downloaded).</p>

<p>The reference linking API shows promise and should eventually be used

as part of an OAI Service Provider.</p>

<H3>
Filling the Archives: EPrints.org Software</H3>

<p>Reference linking and citation analysis only truly become effective when

there is a critical mass of related, linkable content, whether that content

is in open-access archives or journals. For open-access archives, even

when aggregated, other than from those larger subject-focused archives

covered by Citebase, there is as yet insufficient content for linking. It

is possible the example of Citebase and arXiv will motivate authors in

other areas to self-archive their papers, but the OpCit project hasn't

just promoted the benefit of contributing to open-access archives by proxy

example. It has also supported the development of software, known as EPrints.org

software, to build and manage OAI-compliant archives.</p>

<p>EPrints software is undoubtedly the better known product of the OpCit

project. It could be argued that Citebase or similar services will ultimately

have more impact with users, but EPrints is necessary now and plays a critical

role in enabling open-access archives to be filled.</p>

<p>EPrints has evolved from software first developed to manage the CogPrints

cognitive science eprint archive. CogPrints was functionally modelled on

arXiv, but was based on entirely original software. With the emergence

of OAI and the consequent emphasis on institutional archives, it was evident

there would be a need for large numbers of archives smaller than arXiv,

but which would need to operate on similar principles &#151; low cost, largely

automated deposit, indexing and dissemination of author-archived content.

CogPrints software was rewritten by Rob Tansley to make it OAI-compliant,

and then to make it generic, so it could be used as EPrints, which was

further developed within the remit of the Open Citation project to generalise

the author and management interfaces for open-access archives.</p>

<p>Of most significance, EPrints builds archives that comply with the OAI

Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (PMH). This means that any content deposited

within an EPrints-based archive will become visible to users of OAI services,

such as the search services mentioned above, immediately enhancing the

chances of discovery. Authors depositing papers in an EPrints archive are

not required to have any knowledge of OAI metadata: it is generated automatically.</p>

<p>EPrints is aimed at institutions and special-interest communities. In

its current incarnation, the name GNU EPrints (<a href="10hitchcock.html#GNU">GNU</a>)

reflects that it is 
open source and freely available under the GNU General Public License and 
conforms to the strict GNU guidelines for free software. The last major release of EPrints, version

2.0, appeared in February 2002, although it has been updated (now on version

2.1.1) to conform with the latest OAI-PMH (also version 2) announced in

June. Features of EPrints version 2 include:</p>
<ul>

<li>

Internationalised metadata stored as Unicode</li>



<li>

Support for multiple archives on one server</li>



<li>

An improved user interface</li>

</ul>

<p>The practicalities of building an EPrints-based archive are described by

Nixon (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Nixon">Nixon 2002</a>). Meanwhile, EPrints has new features that extend its focus

on institutional research papers. It is now configurable for adoption as

a journal-archive for new open access journals or established journals

converting to open access, e.g., <em>Psycoloquy</em> (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Psycoloquy">Psycoloquy</a>). There are plans to extend EPrints for structured data handling in, for 
example, e-science applications, enabling subparts of very large data 
archives to be used in analysis without the need to copy contents in their 
entirety to the processing site.</p>

<h3>
OpCit and OAI: Improving the Infrastructure</H3>
<p>There has been a surge of activity based on OAI, reflected in research

programs and projects, tools, data and service providers (<a href="10hitchcock.html#VandeSompel2002">Van de Sompel

and Lagoze 2002</a>). The faith of early adopters has proved well founded,

but some repository administrators had their fingers crossed:</p>

<blockquote>"As we have introduced our repository to our faculty and staff,

we have emphasized the point that because they would be depositing their

material in an OAI-compliant archive, it would automatically and painlessly

be discoverable from various other points around the globe. Luckily, we

were right." Roy Tennant (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Tennant">Tennant</a>)</blockquote>


<p>A primary motivator for adoption of OAI has been its promotion by funding

agencies such as JISC in the UK (see Beyond the Project below), the NSF,

Digital Library Federation (<a href="10hitchcock.html#DLF">DLF</a>)

and the Mellon Foundation (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Waters">Waters 2001</a>) in the USA, as well funding from

new programmes such as the Budapest Open Access Initiative (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Budapest">Budapest</a>)

sponsored by George Soros' Open Society Institute. In Europe activity is focused on the Open Archives Forum (<a href="10hitchcock.html#OAF">OAF</a>) and other 
projects funded by the EU's Information Society Technologies 5th Framework 
(IST-FP5)
Programme. The results of these

recent initiatives, and the dramatic increase in momentum they have lately

provided for eprints and for institutional self-archiving, have been chronicled

by Suber (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Suber">Suber 2002</a>).</p>

<p>The Open Citation project has contributed to OAI not just as a data

and service provider, but in other, lower profile ways concerned with enhancing

the efficiency of OAI through registration and validation services, aggregation

and building infrastructure.</p>


<p>At its simplest, basing the OAI-PMH on unqualified Dublin Core metadata

say, interoperability ought to be straightforward in principle. In practice,

unqualified DC is not mandated, and there are various reasons why the quality

of OAI data for harvesting can be compromised. Liu et al. (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Liu2001">Liu 2001</a>)

discovered that not all archives strictly follow the OAI protocol, many

have XML syntax and encoding problems, and some data providers are periodically

unavailable.</p>

<p>One solution is for data providers to be validated for protocol compliance,

but not all data providers register. The registration and validation service

provided by OAI, and managed by Donna Bergmark at Cornell, has other benefits.

Registered archives become accessible by service providers, and validation

helps improve repository maintenance. To simplify registration, EPrints

feeds repository URLs straight into the OAI registration process (if so

desired by the EPrints administrator). A scan of the list of registered

sites (<a href="10hitchcock.html#OAI-sites">OAI sites</a>) shows many

have used EPrints to build repositories.</p>

<p>To improve interoperability, scalability and reliability of OAI services,

OpCit has worked with the Old Dominion University team on infrastructure

components such as proxies and caches (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Liu2002">Liu et al. 2002</a>). Proxies,

transparent layers acting between data providers and harvesters, can be

used to fix simpler encoding errors as part of the delivery process. More

serious errors in the data require an intermediate storage approach: caching

and aggregation. In this case a few large service providers might harvest

and cache metadata from registered OAI repositories, reducing the load

on those archives and serving many smaller harvesters. An OAI aggregator

(OAIA) must in principle be an active cache as it requests new records

from known repositories in advance so it is always up-to-date. An example

OAIA known as 'Celestial' (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Celestial">Celestial</a>), which mirrors

OAI repositories, has been built by Tim Brody from the OpCit team.
</p>

<H3>
Usage and Impact: OpCit Data Mining</H3>

<p>OAI is winning support from repository administrators because it has a

simple and, mostly, effective infrastructure. This feature alone will be

insufficient to attract authors to deposit works in open-access archives.

Many authors perceive, incorrectly, that open-access archives are competing

with other sources, such as journals, for submissions. The role of open-access

archives is to complement journals while establishing distinctive benefits

for authors.</p>

<p>The most compelling benefit any source can offer to authors is scholarly/scientific

impact &#151; the visibility, uptake, usage, and eventually the citation of

their research by other researchers &#151; along with the recognition, resources, and prestige

these bring. Open-access archives, because they are free to authors and

users, maximise access to works and will therefore maximise impact. The

latter prediction may still sound hypothetical, but it is already beginning

to be substantiated by quantitative (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Lawrence2001">Lawrence 2001</a>) and qualitative (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Odlyzko">Odlyzko

2002</a>) evidence. According to Lawrence: "the greatest impact of online availability

is yet to come, because comprehensive search services and more powerful

search methods have become available only recently."</p>

<p>The OpCit project project has access to over 10 years of ArXiv papers

and can identify how citation patterns have changed over that time. Correlations

have been made with (admittedly limited) data on usage of arXiv taken from

the arXiv mirror at Southampton since August 1999. The raw results of this

work can be found in <em>Mining the Social Life of an Eprint Archive</em>

(<a href="10hitchcock.html#Mining">Mining</a>).

Interpretation is complex, but we can present at least two results that

confirm the prediction that open access enhances impact (Figure 4a and Figure 4b).</p>

<br><br><strong>Figure 4b. Maximising access: maximising impact. Data on downloads

and citations for papers in arXiv: high impact

papers are accessed more often and over a more sustained period</strong></p></center>

<p>Figure 4a shows how, over a period of eight years to 1999, the peak

of citations occurs higher and sooner for papers deposited in each succeeding

year. The citation peaks for 1999 and 1998 can be seen after approximately

3-4 months. This is remarkable because it implies that the speed of scientific

communication &#151; the rate of ideas affecting other researchers' ideas &#151; is

increasing dramatically.</p>

<p>As with any large collection of papers, there is a wide variation in

the likelihood of any individual paper being cited. Analysis of citations

identified papers in arXiv that might be categorised as high, medium and

low impact papers. From 132,218 papers in arXiv at the time of the analysis,

595,698 internal citations were extracted, an average of 4.51 citations

per paper. The papers were split so that approximately 1/3 of the citations

were to each category of impact. Papers with no citations to them are referred

to as 'unknown'. The number of papers in each category is shown in Table

1 and graphically in Figure 5.</p>

<p>Returning to Figure 4b, which shows accesses to papers in each category,

it becomes clear that high impact papers are accessed more often and over

a more sustained period than other types of paper. What is not clear from

this analysis alone is whether higher accesses are due to higher citations,

or higher citations are due to higher accesses, but either way the result is

dependent on unrestricted, free access. The relationship between access

and impact is worthy of further study, but what can already be said is

that a clear hierarchy of papers emerges, based entirely on previously

unrecognised usage patterns within arXiv. Brody et al. (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Brody">Brody 2002</a>) explore

further results from this work, showing how arXiv supports an evolving

network of texts commenting on, citing, classifying, abstracting, listing

and revising other texts. Archives are becoming a network of texts rather

than simply a classified collection of texts.</p>

<br><br><strong>Figure 5. Graphical representation of data from Table 1</strong></p></center>

<p>It has to be recognised that impact depends on more than access; another

factor is association, with an established journal title, say. Journal

reputations are founded on peer review. Figure 4 shows that informed authors

can have all three benefits &#151; peer review, access and impact &#151; simply by

depositing a paper in an open-access archive at the same time as submitting

to a peer reviewed journal. Revised versions can similarly be submitted

to both sources simultaneously. For a given paper, publication in a peer

reviewed journal is recognised in the updated OAI record.</p>

<p>Intuitively, authors &#151; and journal publishers too &#151; know that unrestricted

access enhances impact. The biomedical field, which has the largest number

of high-impact journals (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Garfield1996">Garfield 1996</a>), has least reason to alter its

publishing practices, yet initiatives such as NIH's PubMed Central (<a href="10hitchcock.html#PubMed">PubMed</a>)

and the Public Library of Science (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Public">Public</a>)

are evidence that authors now demand more. Publishers may not have warmly

embraced NIH's demand for deposit of published papers in its freely accessible

archive, yet those journals that contribute to PubMed Central do so without

compulsion and are clearly sensitive to their authors' demands as reflected

by the Public Library of Science. It is no coincidence that a biomedical journal publisher, BioMed

Central, has produced the most convincing publishing model so far for open

access journals (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Velterop">Velterop 2002</a>).</p>

<p>It is gradually becoming clearer that in the online age archives and
     journals will play complementary roles in scholarly communication
     and publication. Journals will continue their established tradition
     of providing the essential service of peer review 

(<a href="10hitchcock.html#Harnad1998">Harnad 1998</a>). Meanwhile, OAI open-access archives will facilitate access, and OAI 
services such as Citebase will measure usage and impact.</p>

<H3>Beyond the OpCit Project</h3>

<p>The ideas and efforts that have characterised OpCit will be taken forward

not just in the obvious products of the project, such as Citebase and GNU

EPrints, but in new environments as well. Specifically, the JISC FAIR programme

(<a href="10hitchcock.html#JISC">JISC</a>), which is

just beginning, includes major projects that will seek to extend the culture

of EPrints-based archives in UK universities through the provision and

targetting of new archives and supplementary services:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<a href="10hitchcock.html#SHERPA">SHERPA</a> (Securing a Hybrid Environment for Research Preservation and Access), lead institution: Nottingham University, 

will build EPrints-based archives at six major UK universities, using this

experience to report on the implications for management and quality control

of such archives.</li>

</ul>



<ul>

<li>

<a href="10hitchcock.html#E-Prints">E-Prints UK</a>, Resource Discovery Network, King's College London, 

plans to use Citebase software and citation data from Citebase to enhance

its database for discovery of eprint papers available from Open Archives

hosted at UK universities and colleges.</li>

</ul>




<ul>

<li>

<a href="10hitchcock.html#TARDIS">TARDIS</a> (Targeting Academic Research for Deposit and dISclosure), Southampton

University, will investigate strategies 'to

overcome the technical, cultural and academic barriers', which might be

found to be restricting the development of institutional eprint archives,

by developing a working model of a multidisciplinary institutional archive

based on EPrints.</li>

</ul>




<ul>

<li>

<a href="10hitchcock.html#RoMEO">RoMEO</a> (Rights MEtadata for Open archiving), Loughborough University, 

will canvas users to identify (mis)perceptions about how rights should

be formulated and protected for 'give away' works &#151; "texts from which the

author does not seek sales revenue" &#151; promoting practical approaches that

can "assigned, disclosed, harvested, and displayed" via the OAI-PMH. </li>

</ul>

<H3>Conclusion: What we have learned</H3>

<p>The Open Citation project has produced tools to help OAI data providers

and service providers. The project has been fortunate in being able to

contribute to the broadly-based activities, focused on OAI, that have emerged

since 1999 to support improved scholarly communication through open access

to research papers. We are clear this is the beginning of a transformation

towards more open access, not its end. New tools will emerge to help users and promote authors, for example, 
Paracite (<a href="10hitchcock.html#Paracite">Paracite</a>), a new software agent and search interface for  
parsing and locating raw references on the Web. Open citation data will be 
visualised using simple citation and co-citation mapping tools. Two 
preliminary demonstrators have been produced by the project:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<a href="10hitchcock.html#OpCit-e">OpCit e-Services</a></li>



<li>

<a href="10hitchcock.html#XGQuery">XGQuery</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Beyond this there is also the need to expose and link the research <em>data</em>

on which papers are based in open and freely accessible forms, building

on the work of the nascent 'e-science' and 'grid' development programmes

designed to enable distributed global collaborations on very large data

collections across the Internet. In this context, it can be seen just how

embryonic current investigations are.</p>

<p>The longer-term future is thus exciting, yet uncertain. The legacy of

a project, however, should be borne of experience rather than speculation,

so we offer some concluding thoughts which, although stated before, collectively

give a clear picture of the way forward:</p>

<ul>

<li>

OAI is gathering momentum.</li></ul>



<ul><li>

Software for building OAI repositories is available.</li></ul>



<ul><li>

Institutional archives are being created, but need to be filled by authors.</li></ul>



<ul><li>

Attracting authors requires evidence of services that will improve the

visibility, usage and impact of their works.</li></ul>



<ul><li>

Citation-ranked search and reference linking are examples of OAI services

that do this.</li></ul>



<ul><li>

The infrastructure supporting OAI services continues to be enhanced.</li></ul>



<ul><li>

Resource discovery and current awareness are exemplar OAI services now.

Future services may be citation mapping and co-citation visualisation,

<A name="Anan">preservation</a> management, and personalization.</li>

</ul>
