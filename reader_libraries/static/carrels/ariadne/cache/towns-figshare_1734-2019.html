    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Why am I here?</h2>

<p>At Loughborough University we have been working with Figshare (<a
href="towns.html#ref1">1</a>) to provide a cloud hosted repository (<a
href="towns.html#ref2">2</a>) to house the institution’s research outputs
(datasets, presentations, diagrams and figures etc.)  since 2015. At
the same time the University’s ‘Institutional Repository’ (<a
href="towns.html#ref3">3</a>) for publications (Journal articles, conference
papers, book chapters etc.) has been hosted locally using an instance
of DSpace (<a href="towns.html#ref4">4</a>).</p>

<p>This DSpace instance has become more than a little long in the
tooth and the University recently went out to tender to replace that
system. The winner of that exercise was Figshare and so we are now
gradually working towards both publications and research data
appearing in the one repository.</p>

<p>When I joined the team looking after library systems in IT Services
the purpose of both DSpace and Figshare were explained to me. The
arrangement of having two separate repositories provide what appeared
to be very similar functions seemed odd to me and so I find the idea
of moving to one repository appealing.</p>

<p>And so this is how we answer that question posed back at the start,
why did I attend Figshare Fest 2018? My boss had spoken highly of the
inaugural event 3 years earlier (<a href="towns.html#ref5">5</a>), so when
presented with the opportunity to head to Figshare Towers in London
for a conference I jumped at the chance to learn more and meet other
people from other institutions to hear their insights.</p>

<h2>The location</h2>

<p>Figshare are located on the 7th floor of Kings Place a short
5-minute walk from St. Pancras. You know you have found the right
location when are greeted at the door by the CEO and Founder of the
company. Mark Hahnel was directing traffic to the correct location and
advising on where to get a cup of the hot stuff.</p>

<p>On the subject of coffee, I have to admit to a fair amount of
jealousy when it comes to the Digital Science (<a href="towns.html#ref6">6</a>)
offices hosted by WeWork. There can’t be many offices boasting their
own barista making coffee to order.</p>

<h2>The conference part 1 – Before lunch</h2>

<p>Armed with a steaming hot americano I settled in for the start of
the conference. Mark had swapped his meet and greet guy hat for his
CEO and Founder hat and gave the opening talk centred on updates of
activities within Figshare. It was clear to me from Mark’s talk that
he isn’t a CEO who has been installed to run a technology company but
rather having founded the company and coming from an academic
background he understands the area his company is working in very well
indeed. Mark discussed at length what lies ahead for the product with
one area of particular interest to us Loughborough folks being the
development work to make Figshare a more viable product for operating
as an Institutional Repository.</p>

<p>Following the opening Figshare update we moved on to discussing
data curation for repositories which included some interesting debate
about how to handle curating data from co-authors based at different
institutions both using Figshare.<p>

<p>This was followed by an introduction to FAIR Data by Luiz Bonino,
International Technology Coordinator of Go Fair (<a
href="towns.html#ref7">7</a>). The FAIR principles, standing for Finadable
Accessible Interoperable Reusable, were first published in 2016 as a
set of guidelines intended to be used for the management and
stewardship of scientific data (<a href="towns.html#ref8">8</a>).<p>

<p>Luiz talked us all through the various things that can be done to
meet the FAIR principles such as using unique persistent identifiers
and describing data with rich metadata which includes the persistent
identifier. Some time was given over to discussing how Figshare could
be used to help meet these principles.</p>

<p>Our final session before lunch was a whistle-stop tour of the
public development roadmap for Figshare by Chris Blumzon. So keen was
Chris to get through all the items he wanted to talk about that he had
to be told to stop and breath at one point. We got to hear about the
great many things in the pipeline from the Figshare development team
such as the minting of handles, a new improved admin area, custom item
types, faceted searching, custom and private metadata, comment
moderation and custom thumbnails to mention a few of the things we can
potentially expect to see arriving over the next 12 months.</p>

<h2>The conference part 2 – After lunch</h2>

<p>After lunch and another visit to see the barista, the first part of
the afternoon was given over to case studies of how various
institutions are using Figshare. This was kicked off by Loughborough
University’s own Research Data Manager Dr. Gareth Cole who gave a
presentation on how we are preparing to use Figshare as our
institutional Repository.</p>

<p>Other case study presentations were made by Middlesex University
and Carnegie Mellon University. Listening to David Scherer from
Carnegie talk about "Kilthub" (<a href="towns.html#ref9">9</a>) it was clear that they have faced
and are facing many of the same challenges that we are finding here at
Loughborough.</p>

<p>The second part of that afternoon was taken up by my highlight of
the day. Jan Willem Tulp from the eponymous TULP interactive (<a
href="towns.html#ref10">10</a>) gave an almost hypnotic presentation on
visualising data. He showcased some of the projects he has worked on
taking raw data and turning it into an interactive visual
representation. These included Trillions of Trees for Nature (<a
href="towns.html#ref11">11</a>), Coral and Fish for Figshare (<a
href="towns.html#ref12">12</a>) and the fascinating ESA Star Mapper (<a
href="towns.html#ref13">13</a>).</p>

<p>I would highly recommend visiting not just those projects but also
the others linked to from his website. They are great illustration of
how, with the right skill set and a not inconsiderable amount of
imagination, huge data sets can be turned into something informative,
engaging and visually stunning.</p>

<p>Jan also shared with the group some of the process he goes through
in developing the visualisations, showing us that it was very much an
iterative process to find what looks good and what works. It was clear
this often takes a good deal of thought and experimentation.</p>

<p>Afterwards I spoke with Jan about the technology he used to create
his visualisations as his presentation left me wanting to have a go at
trying to build a visualisation myself.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img alt src="../../images/issue78-dan-towns/image2.jpg" style="width: 640px; border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;"></p>

<p>The conference proper was closed by a keynote on “Undiscovered
Openness” from Dr. Erinma Ochu, Lecturer in Science Communication and
Future Media at The University of Salford. Her talk was introduced by
Alan Hyndman whilst holding a pint of cider and he also included the
somewhat distracting announcement that whilst the barista had finished
for the day the beer and cider taps now had been turned on (WeWork
offices come with a feature they call “Craft on Draft” which means
later in the day you can enjoy a pint at your desk!).</p>

<h2>The conference part 3 – Après Conference</h2>

<p>After the conclusion of the closing keynote Alan Hyndman announced
that Mark Hahnel would now lead the way to the pub. I dutifully
followed and discovered the pub was on the ground floor of the same
building. Suffice to say I was very glad I had booked an open return
to Derby and very much enjoyed the company and a drink or two.</p>

<h2>In conclusion</h2>

<p>I have to say that the conference was a very enjoyable and
interesting experience for me. I had the opportunity to meet a great
many people from other institutions and hear about their
experiences. Much of the time I found myself listening to what was
being discussed rather than actively taking part but this is mostly
down do not being involved in the day to day operation of a
repository. As is no doubt already apparent the part of the conference
I found most interesting came from Jan Tulp and his data
visualisations. This may be because of my history of working in IT on
databases but I think no matter what your background you would have
been hard pushed not to find that subject engaging.</p>

<p>Hopefully I will be able to get a pass to attend Figshare Fest 2019.</p>
