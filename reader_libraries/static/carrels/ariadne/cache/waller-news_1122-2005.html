Through a range of hands-on activities, attendees will investigate suitable Image Management Systems (IMS), be introduced to Metadata, and consider its practical application. It is suitable for anyone who wishes to construct and publish simple image collections, including academics, technicians and library staff, who are developing a departmental resource.</p><p><strong>Create and animate vector graphics using Flash<br>16 September 2005</strong></p><p>This workshop will introduce the underlying theory and provide a practical understanding of the use and properties of vector graphics within the Flash environment. It is suitable for non-technical professionals, who wish to create animated graphics for use on the Web, or in presentations. This workshop requires no prior knowledge of using Flash, though some understanding of digital imaging would be an advantage.</p><p>Full details of each workshop and an online Booking Form can be found at: <a href="http://www.tasi.ac.uk/training/training.html"> http://www.tasi.ac.uk/training/training.html</a></p><p align="right"><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events2"></a></p><h3>OpenURL and Metasearch: New Standards, Current Innovations, and Future Directions</h3><p>A NISO educational workshop:<br>Venue: Washington DC, USA<br>Dates: 19-21 September 2005</p><p>This workshop represents an opportunity to get the latest information on OpenURL and Metasearch, two standards supporting technologies that continue to transform the information landscape. The three-day programme includes a training day for technical staff from all types of content providers (publishers, vendors, and libraries). Training will cover the basics of implementation, available tools, and requirements for standards conformance.

Deposit should take place at the earliest opportunity, wherever possible at or around the time of publication. Research Councils will also encourage, but not formally oblige, award-holders to deposit articles arising from grants awarded before 1 October 2005.

Control over the computing environment in the library can be a significant source of contention between systems/information technology and public services/reference personnel.</p><p>To investigate this relationship, the American Library Association's Machine-Readable Reference Section's User Access to Services Committee (ALA MARS UASC) put together a panel consisting of two systems and two public services professionals as part of the ALA's Annual Meeting in Chicago, USA, on 25 June, 2005. Craig Davis, Director of Adult Services at the Chicago Public Library and Mary Ellen Spencer, Head of Reference &amp; Research Services at Virginia Commonwealth University Library in Richmond, Virginia, represented the reference/public services side. Karim Adib, Director of Library Automation for Chicago Public Library, and Dennis Newborn, Head of Systems for West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia, offered the systems/information technology viewpoint.</p><p>Adib, who is not a librarian by training, pointed out that hardware must be fairly new, the network had to be robust, and the primary responsibility of his staff was to their 'customers' -- the library staff and the users of the library system. Davis agreed that this had been a fairly successful endeavour. In fact, this part of the panel presentation turned into a bit of a 'love fest' - rather than an exploration of tension.</p><p>Dennis Newborn spoke for the information technology viewpoint within academic libraries. His primary concern (and one that is shared widely among academic computing staff regardless of geography) is security. Hacking and viruses can completely shut down productive work in an entire institution, but often success in fending these off also has the effect of protecting users from fully understanding the potential threat. Newborn's experience with a major attack several years ago actually helped his public services colleagues better to understand the seriousness of the situation, as they lost functionality on their staff machines and watched users' computing grind temporarily to a halt. In this case, he asserted, a brush with disaster engendered greater understanding by public services staff of his responsibility to protect the library's assets effectively.</p><p>Earlier in her career Mary Ellen Spencer had also worked in a systems department and so fully understood what 'the other side' was experiencing. She did comment that it would be helpful though if systems staff could consider feedback from public services colleagues as 'usability data' rather than as of 'anecdotal' interest.</p><p>The MARS UASC analysed the panel presentation afterwards and concluded it was worthy of further investigation by the Committee in the form of an article. It is hoped to submit the article to <em>Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly</em> ( ISSN 1094-9054 ) in the summer of 2006.</p><p>For further information contact:<br>Bryna Coonin<br>Co-chair, ALA MARS User Access to Services Committee<br>East Carolina University<br>Greenville, N.C.<br>USA<br><br>Email: <a href="mailto:cooninb@mail.ecu.edu">cooninb@mail.ecu.edu</a><br>Web site: <a href="http://www.library.umaine.edu/staff/MARS_ALA/MARS_UASC_index.htm">http://www.library.umaine.edu/staff/MARS_ALA/MARS_UASC_index.htm</a></p><p align="right">[<em>Received: July 2005</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news5"></a></p><h3>Documents Online will soon be a JISC Collection</h3><p>All Higher and Further Education institutions in the UK will soon have the opportunity to offer their staff and students access to The National Archives' collection of digitised public records -<strong> DocumentsOnline</strong>.

Commencing July 2005, it will offer an optional author-pays model to authors of accepted papers in a range of Oxford Journals titles. Oxford Journals has also amended its post-prints policy to be compliant with the latest National Institutes of Health (NIH) Public Access Policy. Both of these announcements further support Oxford Journals' central remit, as a leading not-for-profit publisher, to bring the highest quality research to the widest possible audience.</p><p>Oxford Open will give published authors in participating Oxford Journals titles the option to pay for research articles to be freely available online immediately on publication. The open access charge for each article will be £1,500 or $2,800, with authors being given the option to pay this amount once their manuscript has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication. Discounted author charges of £800 or $1,500 will be available to authors from institutions that maintain a current online subscription. Authors from developing countries will also be eligible for discounted rates. The online subscription prices of participating journals will be adjusted for 2007 and subsequent years, according to how much content was paid for by authors and thus freely available online during the previous year.</p><p>Further details about Oxford Journals Author Self-Archiving Policy can be found at: <a href="http://www.oupjournals.org/selfarchivingpolicy/"> http://www.oupjournals.org/selfarchivingpolicy/ </a></p><p align="right">[<em>Received: May 2005</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news7"></a></p><h3>UKOLUG Becomes UKeIG</h3><p>The Group's name has changed.

Traditional lending services must be improved, and complemented by online access to information using up-to-date technologies."</p><p>MLA states that in 2002 it oversaw the introduction of computers and Internet access in all 3000 public libraries in England. That year, for the first time in a decade, library visits increased - by 5 million. Last year they shot up by a further 14 million. Mark Wood continued: "We are calling on local authorities to capitalise on the success of the introduction of Internet access by extending library opening times, improving book stock and modernising other aspects of public libraries.</p><p>"We are also calling for urgent investment in library buildings so that they're the sorts of places people want to visit. We know that when libraries are properly funded book borrowing rates and visitor numbers increase, yet most public libraries have suffered from a chronic lack of capital investment. We have commissioned a comprehensive audit of the condition of library buildings and the costs of refurbishment or replacement which we will publish later this year."</p><p>MLA's full response to the Parliamentary Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport's review of public libraries will be available from 29 July on <a href="http://www.mla.gov.uk/information/responses/resp2005.asp">http://www.mla.gov.uk/information/responses/resp2005.asp</a></p><p align="right">[<em>Received: July 2005</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news9"></a></p><h3>MLA Becomes Partner in Cultural Leadership Programme</h3><p>In response to the Government's commitment of £12 million to promote leadership skills within the cultural sector, the Arts Council is developing a cultural leadership programme. Working with sector partners, including MLA, it has published Cultural Leadership Programme - A call for ideas. The document outlines the scope of the proposed programme and signals the start of a consultation process that will inform its further development.</p><p>Along with the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, Arts Council England is supported in this initiative by the Clore Leadership Programme, Creative and Cultural Skills and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.</p><p>The Cultural Leadership Programme will make it possible for the cultural sector to develop and strengthen its leadership and establish a culture of excellence for the future. It will develop the business and leadership skills required to lead in a changing global environment. The programme will address the development needs of leaders at all stages of their careers as well as trustees and board members.</p><p>The Cultural Leadership Programme will run for two years from April 2006 and has two areas of priority:</p><ol><li>Creating a culture of strong leadership To embed a culture of support and development for leaders in the sector.</li><li>Diversity in leadership</li></ol><p>To enhance the diversity in cultural leadership with a particular focus on leaders from Black and minority ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>The Arts Council is seeking partnerships across the sector and to learn from other sectors facing and tackling similar challenges.</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: July 2005</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p>Publication Date: 30-July-2005&nbsp;<br>Publication: Ariadne Issue 44<br>Originating URL: http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue44/newsline/</p>
