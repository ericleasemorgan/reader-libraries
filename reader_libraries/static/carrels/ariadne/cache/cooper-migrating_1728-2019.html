    </div>

    <div class="content">
        

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>At the start of 2019 Ariadne[<a href="cooper.html#ref1">1</a>] moved from being a
Drupal[<a href="cooper.html#ref2">2</a>] site to being a static site. This move
realised a number of benefits for the journal including an improvement
in the site performance and a reduction in the ongoing effort required
for site maintenance.</p>

<h2 id="why-move-away-from-drupal">Why move away from Drupal?</h2>

<p>When the technical running of Ariadne moved from the University of
Bath to Loughborough University in 2015 it was decided to upgrade
Drupal to the latest version[<a href="cooper.html#ref3">3</a>]. This turned out
to be far more intensive task than was originally envisaged. This
trend continued with each security update for Drupal requiring
significant effort to apply to the site.</p>

<p>Within a few weeks of going live, it became obvious that Drupal also
required far more resources than expected. A number of unfriendly bots
had to be blocked from accessing the site due to their aggressive
harvesting practice, which would quickly bring the server load up to
unacceptable levels.</p>

<p>Another mitigation implemented to reduce the tendency for the Drupal
setup to have high server loads was to place it behind a Varnish
cache[<a href="cooper.html#ref4">4</a>]. As published journal articles don&rsquo;t
change after being published the pages can be cached for a long
period. This caching did resulted in a significant reduction in the
number of requests that needed to be served by the Drupal setup
itself.</p>

<p>The downside to the addition of the Varnish cache in front of Drupal
was that it was an additional application that needed to be maintained
by the technical team - and the learning curve for new members of the
technical team to pick up the system was already very steep with just
the intricacies of Drupal and its configuration.</p>

<p>As well as the technical effort required, Drupal was also impacting on
the editorial process. The process of laying out an article was at
times more of a black art than a science.</p>

<p>In summary the decision to move away from Drupal to an alternative
process for publishing Ariadne can be summed up with the following
sentence: It took up too many resources, both server-wise and
person-wise when it should have been a lot easier and quicker for
everyone.</p>

<h2 id="requirements-for-the-new-solution">Requirements for the new solution</h2>

<p>Given the issues with the Drupal setup, the technical team drew up the
following list of requirements for a new solution:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Low maintainence effort</strong> - Any updates or security patching process
should be kept to a minimum.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Low resource impact on servers</strong> - The solution should be able to serve
a large number of pages quickly without significantly impacting on the host
server.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Simple editorial process</strong> - The process to add a new article and issue
should be simple and easy to document.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Reduced learning curve</strong> - Where possible the solution should use
technologies in common use by the technical team.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="wordpress">WordPress</h2>

<p>The technical team has quite a bit of experience of configuring and
using WordPress and so spent some time experimenting with trying to
get a WordPress instance that would meet the identified requirements.</p>

<p>The technical team found that it was certainly lower maintenance
effort for them and they had a lot of trust in WordPress&rsquo;s automated
updates. The impact on the server was also less than
Drupal&rsquo;s. However, the editorial process was still more complex than
required, especially adding new author profiles.</p>

<p>After a while it became obvious that despite being closer to meeting
the requirements when compared to the existing Drupal setup, it still
wasn&rsquo;t as good a solution as the technical team would like.</p>

<h2 id="the-ideal-solution">The ideal solution</h2>

<p>While experimenting with using WordPress the technical team commented
on a number of occasions that the ideal solution from a server
resource perspective would be to simply produce a static site, served
by a standard web server. Their main reasoning being that once
published the content of an article should never change. In fact the
only time that parts of the site should change are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>when a new article is published</p></li>

<li><p>when a new issue is published</p></li>

<li><p>when a journal policy is updated</p></li>

<li><p>when the site&rsquo;s theme is updated</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A suitable solution presented itself when one of the technical team
was learning about Hugo[<a href="cooper.html#ref5">5</a>] and realised that it
would be ideally suited for generating a static site for Ariadne.</p>

<h2 id="how-hugo-works">How Hugo works?</h2>

<p>Hugo lets you separate a site&rsquo;s content from its style. When you generate
the site, Hugo goes through each piece of content and applies the suitable
templates for the content type. Each piece of content may have multiple
templates applied to it, for example an issue will have the <code>table of
contents</code> template applied to produce the HTML table of contents, but it
could also have an RSS feed template applied to it as well to generate the RSS
feed for that issue.</p>

<h2 id="structure-of-the-hugo-project">Structure of the Hugo project</h2>

<p>Ariadne&rsquo;s Hugo project uses the following directories:</p>

<ul>
<li>archetypes</li>
<li>content</li>
<li>public</li>
<li>static</li>
<li>themes</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="archetypes">archetypes</h3>

<p>Archetypes are empty content types. When you create a new piece of content
with Hugo it will use an archetype as the base for the new content file, if one
is available. This avoids people having to remember what each piece of <code>front
matter</code> is required for each content type.</p>

<p>Ariadne has four archetypes defined:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>article</strong> - the archetype for all new Ariadne articles</li>
<li><strong>issue</strong> - the archetype for all new Ariadne issues</li>
<li><strong>author</strong> - the archetype for all new Ariadne author profiles</li>
<li><strong>page</strong> - the archetype used for any pages that aren&rsquo;t articles, issues or
author profiles</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="content">content</h3>

<p>Hugo content consists of two sections, the first section is the <code>front
matter</code> which is structured metadata about the content. The second section
is the content itself.</p>

<p>The <code>front matter</code> can be structured using either YAML[<a
href="cooper.html#ref6">6<a>], TOML[<a href="cooper.html#ref7">7</a>] or JSON[<a
href="cooper.html#ref8">8</a>] and the content itself can be either Markdown[<a
href="cooper.html#ref9">9</a>] or HTML.</p>

<p>Unless explicitly overridden the directory structure under the content
directory maps directly through to the final static site&rsquo;s directory
structure.</p>

<h3 id="public">public</h3>

<p>Hugo renders the final static site in the <code>public</code> directory.</p>

<h3 id="static">static</h3>

<p>Any static files required by the site&rsquo;s content are stored in the <code>static</code>
directory. The underlying directory structure and content is copied into the
<code>public</code> directory when building the final site.</p>

<h3 id="themes">themes</h3>

<p>The <code>themes</code> directory stores the themes that can be used when rendering the
final site. Ariadne&rsquo;s theme directory contains the one <code>ariadne</code> theme.</p>

<p>Each Hugo theme directory contains all the resources specific to that theme,
e.g. layout templates, CSS style sheets, theme images.</p>

<h2 id="developing-the-core-ariadne-theme">Developing the core Ariadne theme</h2>

<p>To get a starting point to develop the Ariadne theme from, a couple of
issues along with their articles and related author profiles, were
manually migrated into site content files and then the static site was
generated using Hugo&rsquo;s default templates.</p>

<p>One by one new templates for each content type were added to the
theme.  New <code>front matter</code> fields were added to the articles and
issues as the need arose. Once the core theme templates were complete
(articles, issues, author profiles, generic pages and homepage - see
<a href="cooper.html#fig1">figure 1</a>) and the required <code>front matter</code> fields were known, the
archetypes for each content type was created.</p>

<p><a name="fig1"></a><a target="_blank" href="../../images/issue78-cooper/ariadneHomepage.png">
    <figure style="text-align: center">
        <img alt="Ariadne Homepage" src="../../images/issue78-cooper/ariadneHomepage.png" width="80%">
        <figcaption>figure 1: Ariadne Homepage</figcaption>
    </figure>
</a></p>

<h2 id="extracting-existing-content-from-drupal">Extracting existing content from Drupal</h2>

<p>With the core archetypes, content directory structure and theme started, the
next step was to extract the existing content from Drupal and populate content
files for each one in the appropriate location in the Hugo project&rsquo;s <code>content</code>
directory.</p>

<p>A few of the top level pages were migrated manually (Homepage, Guidelines,
Privacy Statement and Access Terms and Copyright), but for Issues, Articles and
Author Profiles it was decided that it would be easier to write a Perl script
to extract the data directly from Drupal&rsquo;s database and create the related
content files for the Hugo project.</p>

<p>Developing the export script took about 3 days of effort overall, which was not
only significantly faster than a manual migration would have been, but also
resulted in a consistent migration.</p>

<p>Luckily the images for each article were a lot easier to migrate, as they were
stored under a single <code>images</code> directory in the Drupal setup - which could
simply be copied over to the <code>static</code> project directory. In addition this also
removed any requirement to update the image URLs in migrated content as the
actual URL of the image would stay the same.</p>

<h2 id="revisiting-the-theme">Revisiting the theme</h2>

<p>Once all the content files from Drupal were ready the theme could be
revisited.  This time concentrating on the larger browsing lists
(Archives, Authors and Articles) and taxonomies (e.g. Authors,
Domains, Buzz - a.k.a article keywords), all of which couldn&rsquo;t be
easily developed without having a large number of articles migrated.</p>

<p>Once the theme was complete we could generate a static site version of Ariadne
using Hugo and, while we could manually generate the site and upload it when
publishing a new article, it was decided to investigate automating the
publishing process.</p>

<h2 id="designing-the-continuous-deployment-pipeline">Designing the continuous deployment pipeline</h2>

<p>The manual process to publish new content (article, issue, author profile,
etc.) was:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create the new content with a draft status</li>
<li>Edit the new content</li>
<li>Generate the site and push it to the staging environment</li>
<li>Proof reading by the authors (if anything needs correcting then return to
step 2)</li>
<li>Remove the draft status from the new content</li>
<li>Generate the site and push it to the staging environment</li>
<li>Final proof read by the Editor</li>
<li>Push the site to the production environment</li>
</ol>

<p>As the Hugo project is under git[<a href="cooper.html#ref10">10</a>] version control and using GitLab[<a href="cooper.html#ref11">11</a>] as
the master repository, a GitLab Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous
Deployment (CD) pipeline was created. The CI / CD pipeline was very simple with
just one deploy stage consisting of two tasks. The first task runs on each push
into the GitLab repository and generates the static site, including draft
content, which it then pushes out to the staging environment via <code>scp</code>.</p>

<p>The second task needs to be manually triggered via the GitLab web interface
(see <a href="cooper.html#fig2">figure 2</a>) and generates the static site, excluding draft content, and then
pushes it out to the production environment, also via <code>scp</code>.</p>

<p><a name="fig2"><figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img alt="GitLab CI/CD pipeline interface" src="../../images/issue78-cooper/pipelineDashboard.png">
    <figcaption>Figure 2: GitLab CI/CD pipeline interface</figcaption>
</figure></a></p>

<h2 id="citations">Citations</h2>

<p>In the Drupal version of Ariadne there was a section that listed a
citation for each article. As part of the migration it was decided not
to recreate this section, as how a citation should be formatted is
entirely dependent on where the citation is being published. Instead
it was decided to provide a <code>BibTeX</code>[<a href="cooper.html#ref12">12</a>] and
<code>RIS</code>[<a href="cooper.html#ref13">13</a>] file for each article to enable people
to easily add the article to their citation manager software.</p>

<p>To get Hugo to generate the BibTeX and RIS files required the
definition of two new <code>media types</code> to be added to the project&rsquo;s
configuration (<code>application/x-bibtex</code> and
<code>application/x-research-info-systems</code>) then define two new output
formats (<code>BIBTEX</code> and <code>RIS</code>) and, finally, set the output types for
pages to include these new output formats. At this point Hugo would
try to render the BibTeX and RIS versions of the pages, but fail as it
didn&rsquo;t yet have a template for them.</p>

<p>Adding the appropriate templates involved creating two new page layouts in the
Ariadne theme, one for BibTeX and one for RIS. Hugo would then use these to
generate the <code>.bibtex</code> and <code>.ris</code> files to accompany the HTML version of the
file.</p>

<p>Once the BibTeX and RIS files were being generated the articles template in the
theme was updated to include links to them in the article&rsquo;s aside box.</p>

<h2 id="going-live">Going live</h2>

<p>The process for going live with the new static site version of Ariadne
consisted of removing the Varnish cache and Drupal from the server and
pointing the Apache[<a href="cooper.html#ref14">14</a>] virtual host for
<code>www.ariadne.ac.uk</code> at the static site files on the web server.</p>

<p>The most noticeable difference for the new site was the responsiveness.
Previously the response time between pages had widely varied depending on
whether the page was present in the Varnish cache or not. With the new static
site the performance was not only fast, but also consistent between pages.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Moving to a static site generated via Hugo involved quite a bit of effort, but
the benefits realised for both the editorial and technical aspects has
significantly reduce the ongoing effort required, both by the technical team
and the editorial team. Of course the biggest benefit is that readers of
Ariadne now have a smoother online experience than previously.</p>
