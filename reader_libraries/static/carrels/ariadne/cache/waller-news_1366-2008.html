Yet there is evidence to suggest that their research information skills and competencies have not kept up with the rapid pace of change.</p><p>The focus of this free one day workshop is on a recent study undertaken on behalf of the <a href="http://www.rin.ac.uk/">Research Information Network</a> by the <a href="http://lubswww.leeds.ac.uk/aimtech/">AIMTech Research Group</a> at Leeds University Business School and <a href="http://www.informat.org/">Information Management Associates (IMA)</a>. The published report from the study, <a href="http://www.rin.ac.uk/training-research-info"><em>Mind the skills gap: Information-handling training for researchers</em></a> July 2008) identifies a number of significant gaps and areas for development and makes some key recommendations.</p><p>The workshop will look at the key findings from the report, explore the changing role of key providers of training to postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers (including academic staff in their research role) in relation to research information methodologies and tools and look at the potential for libraries to support researchers by developing direct support in accessing and evaluating research information.</p><h3>Key speakers</h3><ul><li><strong>Dr Iain Cameron</strong> â€“ Head, Research Careers and Diversity Unit, Research Councils UK</li><li><strong>Brian Clifford</strong> â€“ Chair, Research Libraries UK Task Force on Research Support</li><li><strong>Dr Michael Jubb</strong> â€“ Director, Research Information Network</li></ul><h3>Who should attend?</h3><ul><li>Senior managers and IT staff in higher education with responsibility for strategy, research and training of researchers</li><li>Senior librarians responsible for delivering information skills training to researchers</li><li>Training coordinators, staff developers and trainers working with researchers</li><li>Researchers with an interest in information skills training good practice</li></ul><h3>Booking</h3><p>For more information and to book your place, please contact: Gaynor Dodsworth, AIMTech Research and Consultancy Group, Leeds University Business School, email <a href="mailto:G.L.Dodsworth@lubs.leeds.ac.uk">G.L.Dodsworth@lubs.leeds.ac.uk</a> or telephone 0113 3437818.

The first of its kind, this open source software offers a tool-box for deploying a customisable distributed system featuring tools for harvesting and aggregating heterogeneous data sources. A variety of end-user functionalities are applied over this integration, ranging from search, recommendation, collections, profiling to innovative tools for repository manager users.</p><p>A running instance of the software, namely the "European Information Space", maintained by the DRIVER Consortium to aggregate Open Access publications from European Institutional Repositories, can be accessed online at: <a href="http://www.driver-repository.eu/DRIVER-News-Events/PR_D-NET_1_0.html">http://www.driver-repository.eu/DRIVER-News-Events/PR_D-NET_1_0.html</a></p><p>DRIVER Consortium's mission is to expand its content base with high-quality Open Access research output, as well as provide support for repository managers and state-of-the art services for the end-user. By building a robust network of content providers, enhanced with the set of services DRIVER offers, the software's openness of the DRIVER infrastructure has encouraged service providers to develop new applications on top of the basic services. Prototypes of such applications, built to replicate DART Europe DEEP (UK) and RECOLECTA (Spain) portals over the European Information Space, can be accessed at <a href="http://search.dart.driver.research-infrastructures.eu/">http://search.dart.driver.research-infrastructures.eu/</a> and <a href="http://search.recolecta.driver.research-infrastructures.eu">http://search.recolecta.driver.research-infrastructures.eu</a> respectively.</p><p>This threefold interaction between many European stakeholders, including research institutions, centres for IT research and strategic partners from the repository community, positions DRIVER as a leading European portal for scholarly research. The European Information Space offers support to three groups of users:</p><ol><li>The researcher, reader, public. From the DRIVER portal, apart from advanced searching and browsing options, the user can register with the system in order to activate his/her user profile and get alerts, register to collections, subscribe to communities and more services to come.</li><li>The repository manager. Guidelines to repository development are offered to those who wish to set up a repository. In a Web-based registration process that uses an automated validation tool, the repository manager gets feedback on the status of his repository, and suggestions on quality improvements via a personalised support service at the DRIVER helpdesk. Web and wiki-tools update the national status of repository development, providing a network of country representatives and repository managers who interact with European colleagues through the driver website and national contacts.</li><li>The service provider. National consortia, subject-based projects and individual repository developers can act as service providers on top of the basic DRIVER infrastructure, by enriching and/or deploying D-NET v. 1.0 software.</li></ol><h3>The software:</h3><p>The DRIVER D-NET v. 1.0 software is released under the Open Source Apache license with accompanying documentation, and with (limited to capacity) technical support by the DRIVER Consortium technical partners. The infrastructure software is designed to be "open", which means that new service typologies, exposing functionalities not currently available in DRIVER, can be easily integrated with existing services. DRIVER Consortium policies require that all new DRIVER service software, produced by DRIVER Consortium partners or third-party service providers, should be released under the same Open Source Apache license and included in the DRIVER software package.</p><p>The D-NET v. 1.0 software release is also made available to any organisation willing to run independent installations of the DRIVER infrastructure. In this case the interested organisation would be responsible of the maintenance of such a system.</p><p>For more information, and to download the software see: <a href="http://www.driver-repository.eu/D-NET_release_v-1-0">http://www.driver-repository.eu/D-NET_release_v-1-0</a></p><p>[Source: DRIVER/DCC]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: Month Year</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news6"></a></p><h3>MLA: Future of Museum Accreditation Takes Shape</h3><p>As part of the MLA's restructure, a fresh emphasis is being given to 'best practice', excellence, improvement and innovation. Among the latest steps, a positive way forward for the flagship Accreditation scheme has been recently announced.</p><p>The MLA will continue to manage the standard throughout the UK. This will be done as an integral part of the MLA's new Quality and Standards team located in Birmingham. In England, Renaissance hubs will be increasingly involved with the Accreditation process, advising and supporting museums before their applications are submitted, and after they have been considered.</p><p>The assessment of applications, prior to them being put before the Accreditation Panel for decision, will be undertaken by independent expert consultants in England contracted by the MLA. The Accreditation Panel will continue to make the final decisions on behalf of the MLA Board.</p><p>MLA Chief Executive Roy Clare said: "It is fundamental that museums should be supported in, and recognised for, attaining the highest national standards. The Accreditation scheme has become firmly established and highly respected as one of our leading programmes. As we map a stronger future for the MLA, 'best practice' is at the core. The future success of the Accreditation Scheme remains of central importance. I am extremely grateful to all those in the sector, especially including the Accreditation Panel, who give their time and resources to ensuring that the scheme works effectively and efficiently."</p><p>The MLA has appointed a new manager, Samuel Rowlands. Samuel has extensive experience of the scheme having previously worked as the Regional Officer â€“ Museums and Standards for MLA East of England. Emmeline Leary, the current Accreditation Manager leaves MLA in the Autumn.</p><p>Roy Clare added: "I want to pay tribute to Emmeline who, in her 20 years of managing Accreditation and Registration has ensured the integrity and development of the standard."</p><p>The newly formed Quality &amp; Standards team, which covers Accreditation, Designation and Security Advice, is headed up by Isabel Wilson, Project Manager, Quality and Standards. The team's immediate priority is to maintain consistency for the sector during the period of transition. The responsibilities of the regional MLAs are being integrated within the MLA by April 2009.</p><p>[Source: MLA]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: August 2008</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news7"></a></p><h3>Education and Research Sectors Prepare for Access Management Transition</h3><p>Nearly 500 institutions and organisations are completing the transition to a new open standard SAML-compliant access management system and the UK Access Management Federation. The federation will be providing access to approximately 8 million users across the UK.</p><p>In the past three months, membership of the Access Management Federation has risen dramatically as educational institutions and service providers move to take advantage of the numerous benefits of joining. These include improved services to users, easier compliance with regulatory requirements, reduced support requirements and improved data security. Over 90% of HE institutions and more than half of further education providers have joined the Federation.</p><p>The Federation is operated by JANET (UK) on behalf of JISC and Becta and brings the entire UK education and research sector a step closer to achieving single sign-on to network and online resources. The Federation now has over 150 Service Provider platforms registered with over 100 educational publishers such as the BBC, Elsevier, ProQuest, Thomson Scientific, Institute of Physics and a range of smaller publishers, such as Rock's Backpages.</p><p>The access management transition programme, which has supported the first major change in access management for the education and research sectors in ten years, has seen nearly 500 organisations become members of the Federation with over 150 resources made available.</p><p>During the last two years the programme fostered a now well-established community of practice to share knowledge and take the sector forward, established a centre of expertise at EDINA and has placed the UK at the forefront of international developments in this field.</p><p>Essential elements in successful embedding of access management expertise have been the provision by JISC of 120 free training places at Netskills, outputs from early adopter projects, the deployment of access management solutions for 12 publishers and service providers, the deployment of software for 40 smaller colleges and the detailed review of over 200 resource lists from institutions. In the future JANET UK and Netskills will continue to develop training courses with Netskills delivering ones focused on Service Provider requirements this September.</p><p>Further information:<br><a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/stories/2008/07/accessmanagement.aspx">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/stories/2008/07/accessmanagement.aspx</a></p><p>[Source: JISC]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: July 2008</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news8"></a></p><h3>JISC: Greener Technology Workshops</h3><p>Looking at ways to save money and help Further and Higher Education institutions enable their technology to work greener is the aim of a series of workshops being run by the JISC-funded SusteIT Project over the coming months.</p><p>The first in the series of five workshops, held at Cardiff University last month discussed the latest solutions in minimising the environmental impact of servers and high-performance computing. Delegates at the one-day event explored the issues of energy-efficient configuration, cooling and power supply in data centres.</p><p>With pressure from the government on the whole public sector to reduce its carbon emissions, the event was designed to investigate how institutions can make their data centres more efficient. The workshop looked in detail at a number of approaches to efficent energy use and cooling in the data centre. Delegates were able to see first-hand the solutions adopted by Cardiff University.</p><p>One of the themes of the workshop was that green ICT issues need to be addressed at an institutional level. In particular, collaboration between the IT and Estate departments, along with their suppliers, is crucial, if sustainable solutions are to be possible.</p><p>Dr Hugh Beedie, Chief Technology Officer at Cardiff University explained that the event was particularly successful as, "the site tour enabled a first hand experience of good practice of the sustainable solutions that are currently in use at the university."</p><h3>Further Workshop:</h3><p>2 September 2008, Sheffield: The Sustainable Desktop:</p><p>This workshop will highlight examples of good practice in how further and higher education institutions can reduce their desktop computing energy consumption and carbon footprint by:</p><ul><li>powering down PCs when not is use</li><li>harvesting idle CPUs through grid computing techniques</li><li>purchasing devices with low power consumption</li><li>substituting thin client devices for PCs</li></ul><h3>Further information:</h3><p>The Sustainable Desktop<br><a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/events/2008/09/sustainableit.aspx">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/events/2008/09/sustainableit.aspx</a></p><p>Further workshops are planned for the Autumn 2008 and early next year on Intelligent Buildings, Virtualisation and Shared Services as well as on issues affecting the Further Education sector.</p><h3>Further information:</h3><p><a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/stories/2008/08/greenictworkshops.aspx">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/stories/2008/08/greenictworkshops.aspx</a></p><p>[Source: JISC]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: August 2008</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news9"></a></p><h3>Museums, Libraries and Archives Greet Olympic Handover</h3><p>Over 100 museums, libraries and archives have signed up to host events to celebrate the Olympic Handover and the start of the Cultural Olympiad, marking the start of the UK's Olympic journey. The activities â€“ part of MLA's Setting the Pace programme â€“ are timed to coincide with the Handover from the Beijing Games on 24 August 2008 and the start of the Cultural Olympiad on the weekend of the 26 - 28 September 2008.</p><p>Setting the Pace is the programme to support museums, libraries and archives vital contribution to the UK's four-year Cultural Olympiad. Andrew Motion, MLA Chair said: "Our museum, library and archive collections are a wonderfully rich reflection of the world's complex cultural identities. It's absolutely right that they should play this crucial role in allowing people throughout the country to take part in the Cultural Olympiad, and to celebrate the Games."</p><p>Phase one of Setting the Pace has two elements - The People's Record, which for the first time in Olympic history will capture people's experience of living in an Olympic host nation; and Literature and Stories, which will use collections as creative inspiration for young poets, and as a source for story telling and performance events.</p><p>Setting the Pace will complement Stories of the World â€“ one of the ten major projects of the Cultural Olympiad, led by MLA in partnership with the London Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG). Stories of the World will showcase reinterpreted collections through a network of exhibitions. Further details will be announced during the launch of the Cultural Olympiad.</p><h3>Further information:</h3><p>LOCOG <a href="http://www.london-2012.co.uk/LOCOG">http://www.london-2012.co.uk/LOCOG</a>/<br>Cultural Olympiad <a href="http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/cultural-olympiad/">http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/cultural-olympiad/</a></p><p>[Source: MLA]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: July 2008</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p class="footer">Publication Date: 30-July-2008 Publication: Ariadne Issue 56<br>Originating URL: http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue56/newsline/</p>
