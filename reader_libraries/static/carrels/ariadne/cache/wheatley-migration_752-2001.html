        <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue29/camileon#author1">Paul Wheatley</a> explores migration issues for the long-term preservation of digital materials.
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p><h3>Aims</h3><p>This paper is intended to continue the debate on the different uses of <strong>migration</strong> for the long-term preservation of digital materials. This discussion will hopefully form the basis of future comparisons between <strong>migration</strong> and <strong>emulation</strong> as part of the CAMiLEON project&rsquo;s investigation of <strong>emulation</strong> as a digital preservation strategy (A look at some of the practical aspects of an <strong>emulation</strong> preservation strategy can be found in &ldquo;Emulation, Preservation and Abstraction&rdquo; [<a href="camileon.html#1">1</a>] by David Holdsworth and Paul Wheatley).</p><p>To this end there are three key aims:</p><ul><li>To break down the traditionally broad view of <strong>migration</strong> into more easily digestible components and to develop some standard terminology for these different <strong>migration</strong> practices.</li><li>Consider the options for the <strong>migration</strong> of digital materials by working from a number of practical examples.</li><li>Begin to discuss some of the issues arising from this categorisation of <strong>migration</strong> options.</li></ul><p>This paper provides no easy answers and there is still a long way to go. Hopefully it does take us at least one step nearer to the confident use of <strong>migration</strong> as a viable tool for long term digital preservation.</p><h4>What is migration?</h4><p><strong>Migration</strong> of digital materials in the traditional sense has typically only dealt with relatively simple digital objects that are converted in a series of steps to current platforms. Little research has been conducted as to its use beyond this level. Access to word processor files, statistical data files and bitmap image files has been maintained by migrating from one format to another, often by the import facilities of current application software. With more complex digital objects it is not immediately clear how these would be migrated or what <strong>migration</strong> in this context actually means. Furthermore, is <strong>migration</strong> at all useful in this field or is <strong>emulation</strong> always a better strategy for preserving these more complex objects?</p><p>The CPA/RLG report [<a href="camileon.html#2">2</a>] provides a useful and broad definition of <strong>migration</strong> as &ldquo;&hellip;a set of organised tasks designed to achieve the periodic transfer of digital materials from one hardware/software configuration to another, or from one generation of computer technology to a subsequent generation.&rdquo; This paper will attempt to describe what these different tasks could be in a practical sense and discuss their relative usefulness in different contexts. Implementations of some or all of these <strong>migrations</strong> may provide comparisons for the user testing of these resources in an emulated environment (The CAMiLEON [<a href="camileon.html#3">3</a>] project will be performing user testing of various digital resources both in their original environments and in emulated environments). This paper will also introduce the concept of <strong>recreation</strong> as a an alternative digital preservation strategy that is related to <strong>migration</strong>.</p><h4>Migration, the story so far</h4><p>The influential Open Archiving Information System (OAIS) [<a href="camileon.html#4">4</a>] breaks down <strong>migration</strong> into four categories; <strong>refreshment</strong>, <strong>replication</strong>, <strong>repackaging</strong> and <strong>transformation</strong>. This is useful, but we can certainly go much further. In particular, <strong>refreshment</strong>, <strong>replication</strong> and <strong>repackaging</strong> are distinct processes in themselves, which are more appropriately associated with the general management of an archive. These processes merely ensure that we maintain a reliable copy of the bytestream of our digital object (<strong>refreshment</strong>) or a manageable package within an OAIS archive (<strong>replication</strong> and <strong>repackaging</strong>). Surely it is sensible not to group these within the overall moniker of <strong>migration</strong>. OAIS <strong>transformation</strong> actually modifies the bytestream of a digital object (so that it can be interpreted on a current computer platform) and this is what will specifically be considered as the process of <strong>migration</strong> within this paper.</p><p>OAIS goes further in breaking down this <strong>migration</strong> into two more categories; <strong>reversible migration</strong> and <strong>non-reversible migration</strong>. This is a crucial distinction. The only way to guarantee that no information will be lost when a <strong>migration</strong> is performed is the litmus test of a backwards <strong>migration</strong> which recreates the original object precisely.</p><p>Charles Dollar [<a href="camileon.html#5">5</a>] begins to break down the overall task of preservation into different categories and makes some important distinctions between <strong>migration</strong> and related processes (see &ldquo;Authentic Electronic Records: Strategies for Long-Term Access&rdquo; by Charles Dollar). He is keen to highlight the differences between maintaining the &ldquo;processibility&rdquo; of digital objects and the function of actual <strong>migration</strong>. The former relies on import/export facilities of current software to convert digital objects to a current format, and the latter involves a far more involved process of performing a <strong>migration</strong> to a current format without these existing application aids and perhaps little knowledge of the formats and systems involved. However, a third and related strategy, which needs to be highlighted, is the Cedars Project&rsquo;s cautious but sensible take on <strong>migration</strong>. This aims to preserve both the original bytestream and a tool for understanding or interpreting the original object. This is discussed in more detail under section a href=&ldquo;#3.5&rdquo;&gt;3.5.</p><p>Dollar identifies maintaining the authenticity of a digital object as a key aim in the <strong>migration</strong> process. He suggests that migrating objects may result in some loss of their original properties. However, we have to be far more pessimistic and accept that <strong>migration</strong> will always result in some losses of this kind. This makes it essential to identify these side effects in order that the best preservation method is chosen for each circumstance and that the implications of any <strong>migration</strong> action that is taken are fully understood.</p><p>&ldquo;Risk Management of Digital Information : A File Format Investigation&rdquo; [<a href="camileon.html#6">6</a>] by Lawrence et al, attempts to quantify the risks involved in the use of <strong>migration</strong> and analyses several commercially available <strong>migration</strong> tools for their relative accuracy. This practical investigation has led to the identification of some key requirements for <strong>migration</strong> software:</p><ul><li>Read the source file and analyze the differences between it and the target format.</li><li>Identify and report the degree of risk if a mismatch occurs.</li><li>Accurately convert the source file(s) to target specifications.</li><li>Work on single files and large collections.</li><li>Provide a record of its conversions for inclusion in the migration project documentation.</li></ul><p>These requirements are equally applicable for tools used as part of the three migration strategies identified above, but few existing tools come close to meeting all of them.</p><p>Dollar envisions a diminished role for <strong>migration</strong> in future times as the producers of digital objects move towards standard or open formats and the application software, which renders proprietary format objects, provide built in export and import features which can be relied on to perform format &ldquo;conversion&rdquo;. Unfortunately it is not in the interest of software developers to rely completely on open formats like RTF and there is little interest from publishers in providing digital objects in any form other than those desired by current users. The trend of increasing complexity in &lsquo;published&rsquo; digital objects also looks set to continue. With these driving forces working against the common sense voice of the preservation community it seems rather optimistic that our preservation challenge will become easier with time. To this end we must continue to be sceptical of the longevity of current format &lsquo;standards&rsquo; (and platforms) and develop suitable <strong>migration</strong> or <strong>emulation</strong> strategies, before it is too late to preserve much of our digital heritage.</p><p>The difficulties inherent in the understanding and interpretation of data formats, whose design has been influenced by commercial software developers, is illustrated all too well by Lawrence et al. The report reveals that even when format specifications are publicly available they are often incomplete. Furthermore a substantial component of file format specifications often consist of non-standard elements which &ldquo;provide the competitive edge for third-party software and rarely are openly circulated.&rdquo;</p><h4>1.4 Who are we preserving for?</h4><p>This is a broad look at preserving a range of digital objects and no assumptions about who the materials are being preserved for have been made. A software historian will obviously have very different requirements to those of a sociologist solely interested in the raw intellectual content of an object. Each digital object has a range of significant properties (see [<a href="camileon.html#7">7</a>] A blueprint for Representation Information in the OAIS model&rdquo; by David Holdsworth and Derek Sergeant) that we may be interested in preserving, but few preservation methods retain all of them. Performing <strong>migration</strong> in order to preserve is, to a certain extent, always going to be a contradiction. By changing the form or even the structure of a digital object the final output will not be a strict preservation of the original. In many cases this is acceptable but it is important to consider very carefully and understand fully the potential loss of content and structure when using <strong>migration</strong> as a preservation strategy. The only kind of <strong>migration</strong> which does not pose a significant risk of loss is a <strong>reversible migration</strong>.</p><p>A useful series of questions that should be asked before preserving a digital object might be:</p><ul><li>Who are we preserving for?</li><li>Why are we preserving?</li><li>What are the relevant significant properties of the object, given the answers of the above?</li><li>Which method of preservation will most accurately preserve these significant properties within time/cost constraints.</li></ul><p>It should be noted that assumptions have not been made as to any particular starting point from which a preservation action may take place. Access to the object running on the original platform may be available in some cases. Alternatively future historians may be engaged in &lsquo;digital archaeology&rsquo; and have no information or experience of a certain object&rsquo;s format, never mind access to its original platform and running environment.</p><h4>BBC materials</h4><p>The BBC Micro platform [<a href="camileon.html#8">8</a>] was chosen as a source for the test materials for several key reasons. Primarily it offers a source of material that is at risk of loss and at the same time contains some valuable intellectual content that is worth preserving. A wide range of educational material was produced for the BBC Micro platform, much of which is in danger of being lost. Examples include a range of software produced for the Micro Electronics Programme and the BBC Domesday Project which collected together 2 laser discs worth of social and geographical material on the UK. A comprehensive description of the Domesday Project, by one of the original project team, can be found online [<a href="camileon.html#9">9</a>].</p><p>Working with material that is not current allows ourselves to be placed in the role of the archivist working to preserve materials that are becoming obsolete, rather than simply performing arbitrary and unrealistic tests on current materials.</p><p>The BBC materials were selected to provide a cross section of data types and complexity across a fairly small number of resources. All these resources and their respective software applications (where applicable) are available for download on the Internet for use on the original hardware, under <strong>emulation</strong> or as the source for a <strong>migration</strong> of some kind. Appendix A provides a brief description of these applications. Obviously these examples are not directly analogous to every instance where <strong>migration</strong> could be used, but they do offer a starting point for this bottom up development and discussion of <strong>migration</strong> strategies.</p><h4>Terminology</h4><p>It is abundantly clear that many <strong>migration</strong> terms (namely <strong>conversion</strong> , <strong>translation</strong>, <strong>transformation</strong> and indeed <strong>migration</strong> itself) have taken on meanings from several disciplines leading to much potential for confusion. In the following discussions an attempt has been made to avoid misleading terms and to use new more explicit ones where appropriate.</p><h3>Preservation processes</h3><p>The following represents an attempt to break down <strong>migration</strong> as a generalised term into the different practical <strong>migration</strong> tasks or methods available for digital preservation. I will then describe the outputs of these preservation methods when applied to our test materials in the table below. The final section of the paper will discuss these options, their implications and their usefulness (or otherwise) in different situations.</p><h4>Minimum preservation</h4><p><strong>Minimum preservation</strong> refers to preserving a copy of the bytestreams that make up the original object (a copy of the original bytestream should always be retained in addition to any other <strong>migrations</strong> that modify the original).</p><h4>Minimum migration</h4><p>This method represents fairly trivial <strong>migration</strong> tasks that require very little technical work. This is a simple way of improving a <strong>minimum preservation</strong> for human viewing. These tasks could be performed by hand or automated using a software tool as a simple example of <strong>automatic conversion migration</strong> (see below). A possible example of a <strong>minimum migration</strong> could be a word processor file that is stripped of all but the common ASCII characters. This process would naturally remove all formatting and structure from the document, but would be a very simple, cheap and easy way of gaining access to the raw text of the document.</p><h4>Preservation Migration</h4><p>The three forms of preservation <strong>migrations</strong> defined below combine the most basic form of access to the intellectual content, with a non-technical way of preserving some of the look and feel of the original digital object. Dollar sites that &ldquo;In some instances where it is technically possible to preserve all the functionality and integrity associated with electronic records during <strong>migration</strong>, the costs of doing so may exceed available resources.&rdquo; A <strong>preservation migration</strong> is an example of a possible strategy in this situation. Obviously the additional information recorded will create a new preservation issue in itself, so the data formats used should be considered carefully, with an eye for longevity.</p><ul><li><strong>Basic preservation migration</strong>. This involves recording screen shots of the software in use. This could be a snapshot of the actual screen display on the obsolete platform, or a photo of the VDU while the digital object is viewed.</li><li><strong>Annotated preservation migration</strong>. A more comprehensive record than the <strong>basic preservation migration</strong> which includes textual descriptions and annotations describing the function and look and feel of the object in question.</li><li><strong>Complex Preservation migration</strong>. As above, but using simple additional methods to capture descriptive information about the original object. An example of which could be captured video sequences to record key processes in the use of the digital object (eg. For a word processor document this might involve recording the sequences of running the word processor application, loading the digital document and scrolling through some of its content).</li></ul><h4>Recreation</h4><p>A <strong>recreation</strong> is the re-coding of a digital object by hand. With a document this could mean re-typing the text in a current application and adding formatting to match the original. At the other end of the scale, a complex software object could be re-coded on a current platform from scratch.</p><h4>Human conversion migration</h4><p>A <strong>human conversion migration</strong> uses exactly the same processes of reproducing the function of the object, but some element of the original object (usually the data rather than the software) will be incorporated in the final migrated object. An example would be a <strong>human conversion migration</strong> of the BBC Domesday [<a href="camileon.html#7">7</a>] object which combined the original (or <strong>automatically conversion migrated</strong> versions of the original) image and textual data with a newly recreated or re-coded software front end.</p><h4>Automatic conversion migration</h4><p>An <strong>automatic conversion migration</strong> uses a software tool to interpret and modify a digital object into a new form. A typical example would be to take a word processor file from the BBC and output the object as a Word98 document. This is a good example of a traditional view of <strong>migration</strong>.</p><p>The following table describes the practical output of these different methods of preservation on the BBC example resources. Note that I have not considered <strong>emulation</strong> strategies to be within the scope of this document.

The raw bytestreams are hand edited in hex or text editors to produce a clear human understandable text output. In the case of the View files, a look at the raw bytestream in an editor reveals readable chunks of ASCII text with some control codes which can be stripped away by hand or a simple <strong>migration</strong> tool (perhaps even the search and replace features of modern text editors). This could provide a better representation of one of the significant properties (i.e. the intellectual content of the raw textual data) of word processor files that do not rely on a large amount of formatting. The advantage of this method is its simplicity and ease of execution in comparison to an <strong>automatic conversion migration</strong> or complete re-keying of the data. With the ViewStore database, this method also seems to make some sense where cost is an issue. Saving a text dump of the database view loses all of the database functionality, but it does give a cheap and reliable way of getting to a substantial amount of the intellectual content. As long as the original bytestream is maintained along with any relevant documentation (in this case the valuable original ViewStore manual which describes the ViewStore file format in detail) for the possibility of better preservation work in the future, this <strong>migration</strong> method could be a useful stop gap measure.</p><p>In the case of the Human Digestive System object, graphical data is converted to a current graphic format. It could be argued that this is a more complex operation that should come under the banner of an <strong>automatic conversion migration</strong>. However, at this level I&rsquo;ve considered the conversion between bitmap graphics formats as a relatively trivial task and so have included it here.</p><p>Obviously with regard to <strong>migration</strong> costs this is not very technical work, so unit costs will be small but the overall cost for a large number of files could be prohibitive. If an automated approach is taken where a simple conversion tool is produced to perform the <strong>migrations</strong>, there will be a single initial cost after which unit costs will be low.</p><h4>Preservation migrations</h4><p>If <strong>emulation</strong> or code conversion of the Chuckie Egg object is not possible for technical or cost reasons then it would seem prudent to preserve as much of the look and feel of the original as possible by taking a visual record. For the object to be recreated in the future by re-coding, a video record of the game in action would be invaluable. There are obviously doubts over authenticity of this kind of &ldquo;preservation&rdquo; and important questions about what we&rsquo;re actually trying to preserve. For many preservation purposes these strategies could be seen as woefully inadequate, but in the absence of alternatives, a last ditch effort to record as much information as possible may be all that can realistically be done. With the rapid obsolescence of computing platforms and the vast amount of digital material at risk, compromises between the quality of preservation work and the reality of losing valuable data may have to be made.</p><p>With regard to more simple digital objects, a <strong>preservation migration</strong> of a View file could actually be seen as a sensible way of preserving digital objects of this kind. A large quantity of data in View format could be preserved with a <strong>minimum migration</strong> or (more usefully) an <strong>automatic conversion migration</strong>, but with a small number of files preserved additionally using a <strong>preservation migration</strong>. We then retain at least some record of the look and feel of the original environment in which the objects were created. This goes a long way to reduce the costs involved in this kind of preservation, where we require at least some record of the object&rsquo;s original environment. This would be far cheaper than the up front cost of producing an emulator or a <strong>recreation</strong> of the object (or its application software in the case of a digital document).</p><h4>Recreation</h4><p>It&rsquo;s important to consider <strong>recreation</strong> as a different process to <strong>migration</strong> (despite many similarities to the execution of a human conversion <strong>migration</strong>) as it is a process of creating a new object which re-produces the significant properties of the original without incorporating any elements of the original object.</p><p>The re-keying of a View document into a current word processor is probably the least technical approach to preservation here and is obviously open to the introduction of errors or other changes to the data. However in some cases it could be the method of preservation chosen. When we cast the same strategy across to more complex objects however, we quickly see a range of further issues and possible problems developing. Re-keying a ViewStore database into a current database application brings up many questions of authenticity and accuracy but even before that it&rsquo;s important to look at how the work would be done. With the object running on the original BBC system and software, reproducing the intellectual content on a current platform seems quite reasonable. But without the original to work from, a <strong>recreation</strong> looks like a difficult job. Working from a <strong>minimum migration</strong> with little technical knowledge of the ViewStore file structure, much of the intellectual content could be lost. A good Preservation <strong>migration</strong> may have helped to save this data for a future <strong>recreation</strong>. It should be noted that leaving preservation work until after the platform in question has become obsolete and unavailable will introduce further risks of the loss of significant properties.</p><p>A <strong>recreation</strong> of Chuckie Egg complicates these issues further and this is illustrated very well by the existing implementations of this method available on the Internet. What constitutes an authentic <strong>recreation</strong> of an arcade game? The best Chuckie Egg conversion provides an almost pixel perfect visual copy of the original game. But place a hardened games player with experience of the original game in front of it and they will quickly pick up on subtle differences in the game play that are different from the original. Asked the question &ldquo;Is this Chuckie Egg&rdquo;, they might reply with a definite &ldquo;no&rdquo;. To many, the exact details of the &lsquo;feel&rsquo; of a computer game may seem irrelevant in this context, but in fact Chuckie Egg acts as a very clear example of the potential for the loss of what constitutes a key part of the intellectual content of many interactive digital objects.</p><p>Further to the notion of recreating an object authentically, are there in fact cases where recreating the dated user interface of an object may not be ideal? Does the preserver take the opportunity to enhance access to the reproduced intellectual content of the original?</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong> has a high unit cost, and depending on the complexity of the object in question this could be prohibitive in a lot of situations. If a considerable amount of effort is going to be spent recreating several objects from one particular platform it may be more worthwhile to produce one emulator which will preserve all of these objects.</p><p>A well implemented <strong>recreation</strong> of a complex object may offer advantages that make the high unit cost of such work worthwhile in some circumstances. It could be argued that such a <strong>migration</strong> of Chuckie Egg in a modern high level language like C would actually preserve many of the software functions behind the game in an easily understood way. Making it far more understandable at least than the original 6502 machine code of which the original is encoded. For an exceptional digital object, which warranted good preservation, this could be seen as a useful strategy.</p><h4>Human conversion migration</h4><p>Much of my discussion of <strong>recreation</strong> as a preservation strategy is applicable in the use of <strong>human conversion migration</strong> which recreates software elements of a digital object while re-using as much of the data of the original object as possible. The advantage of this strategy is that a <strong>migration</strong> of the data elements of the original object could contribute to a more accurate reproduction of the object&rsquo;s significant properties.</p><h4><a name="3.5">Automatic conversion migration</a></h4><p><strong>Automatic conversion migration</strong> uses a software tool to automatically convert digital objects to a current environment. With word processor and database files, this can be seen as one of the traditional uses of <strong>migration</strong>. Although many consider this to be the best way to migrate and preserve an object, it should be noted that preservation of this kind still only retains some of the intellectual content. Nothing of the original environment in which the object was created in is preserved and there is no guarantee that all of the formatting and structure will be retained.</p><p>Although <strong>automatic conversion migration</strong> could be used to convert a batch of files to a current format, which would then be used and preserved as the primary objects, this process will have to be repeated when the current format becomes obsolete. Hence further <strong>migration</strong> costs will be incurred and additional losses of significant properties may occur.</p><p>A more useful approach is that of <strong>migration on request</strong>, conceived by the CEDARS project [<a href="camileon.html#10">10</a>]. Original objects are maintained and preserved in addition to a <strong>migration</strong> tool which runs on a current computing platform. This would be employed by users to convert the original bytestream of the object they want to use into a current format (This process will be formalised in chapter 5 of the CEDARS project [<a href="camileon.html#10">10</a>] final report). When the current platform becomes obsolete the <strong>migration</strong> tool will no longer work, so the preservation problem in this case is obviously focused on the maintenance of the <strong>migration</strong> tool. Many strategies for ensuring the longevity of a <strong>migration</strong> tool are equally applicable to those used in emulator development (See &ldquo;Emulation, Preservation and Abstraction&rdquo; [<a href="camileon.html#1">1</a>] by David Holdsworth and Paul Wheatley), but much further work needs to be done in this area. Is there an existing format which would be an ideal middle ground for a <strong>migration</strong> tool to convert objects to, before output to a current format for use? And hence can a standard <strong>migration</strong> tool framework be developed, into which read or write modules (which understood specific file formats) could be plugged?</p><p>There are many advantages to this <strong>migration</strong> approach:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Code which interprets a specific obsolete format need only be produced once.</li><li>The actual <strong>migration</strong> is performed on the fly when objects are required by users. So there are no volume dependent costs when a large number of objects of a specific format, are migrated.</li><li>The original bytestream is always interpreted so there is only one <strong>migration</strong> process where the loss of significant properties can occur.</li><li>Proving the authenticity of the preserved object is more straightforward if the object being preserved is the original bytestream.</li><li>Working within a framework for read and write <strong>migration</strong> modules reduces the workload required to be able perform the litmus test of a <strong>reversible migration</strong>, hence guaranteeing that the migrated object is an accurate representation of the original object.</li><li>Preserving the original bytestream and a tool to migrate it is not incompatible with a parallel strategy of <strong>emulation</strong>.</li></ul><p>With complex objects to preserve its not even clear if an <strong>automatic conversion migration</strong> of the original code is possible, especially if associated resources like graphics or data files also have to be dealt with. With many objects (eg. Multimedia programs) this necessitates a specific solution in each case. This is highly technical and therefore likely to be costly. Alternate strategies like <strong>recreation</strong> or <strong>emulation</strong> are likely to be more suitable in this situation.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>It is clear that <strong>migration</strong> and <strong>emulation</strong> strategies will both play an important role in the long-term preservation of digital materials. <strong>Migration</strong> will be crucial for the preservation of more simple data objects and <strong>emulation</strong> will undoubtedly be essential for preserving complex objects that incorporate software elements. However the use of <strong>migration</strong> or <strong>recreation</strong> strategies for preserving objects of particular outstanding value should not be underestimated. For many objects both <strong>migration on request</strong> and <strong>emulation</strong> strategies which interpret the original bytestream will provide useful methods of access for different users of these materials. It is not unrealistic to consider providing more than one means to render a digital object especially if both objects and rendering tools are managed in a sensible way (see Representation Nets in &ldquo;A blueprint for Representation Information in the OAIS model&rdquo; [<a href="camileon.html#6">6</a>] by David Holdsworth and Derek Sergeant).</p><p>Although much recent work has gone a long way to establish the terminology that provides a common language for the discussion of preservation issues, the description of <strong>migration</strong> terms in particular has remained relatively confused. To continue progress in the development of practical preservation strategies we should not be afraid to introduce new and more specific language or to redefine ambiguous terms of old. This paper has gone some way to tackling this problem, but there is still a long way to go.</p><h3>Appendix</h3><h4>View</h4><p>View was one of the first and most widely used word processing applications on the BBC Micro, and was released under the Acornsoft label.</p><h4>ViewStore</h4><p>ViewStore shared the same origins as View, but targeted the database market. ViewStore was quite advanced for a home database application of its day, but it only allowed very simple relationships between tables of data.</p><h4>Human Digestive System</h4><p>This educational software was typical of many new learning tools of the day. Textual information and diagrams are combined with programmed animation to describe the functions of a human digestive system. The application also includes test sections which quiz the user on their learning. The Human Digestive System is a good example of software produced under the Micro Electronics Program (MEP) project.</p><h4>Chuckie Egg</h4><p>Chuckie Egg was considered one of the classic arcade games of its day. Although not technically advanced for its time, the game&rsquo;s popularity presents interesting options for user testing comparisons of the game under <strong>emulation</strong> or in a migrated state. Will the game under <strong>emulation</strong> bring back the original look and feel for a user who has played the game in the eighties?</p><h3>Acknowledgements</h3><p>Many thanks to both the CAMiLEON and CEDARS project teams for their invaluable contribution of ideas and critique.
