The tutorial will then move on to demonstrate how institutions can make use of the DRAMBORA toolkit to design, develop, evaluate, and refine new or existing trusted digital repository systems and workflows. This will involve a walk-through of the toolkit sections with practical examples based on the pilot audits. Participants were encouraged to draw upon and share their own experiences during this discussion. Participants will receive a hard copy of the various DRAMBORA worksheets to take away with them so they could begin to assess their own repositories and workflows or start developing their own repository system.</p><p>This event is being held in cooperation with the Society of Archivists (SoA) Annual Conference. The SoA conference entitled 'Differing Directions: Challenging Communities' tackles many of the important issues regarding the future of archives. For more information on the conference, please see: <a href="http://www.archives.org.uk/thesociety/conference2007belfast.html">http://www.archives.org.uk/thesociety/conference2007belfast.html</a></p><h3>Benefits of Participation</h3><p>This course will enable attendees to:</p><ul><li>Comprehend the concepts of trust with regards to digital repositories</li><li>Recognise the need for evidence-based evaluation for building trust in digital repositories</li><li>Understand how the DRAMBORA toolkit can be used to help design and develop systems and workflows that can help build trusted digital repositories</li><li>Obtain skills needed to undertake a thorough assessment of digital repositories using the DRAMBORA toolkit</li><li>Appreciate the range of staff and skill-sets required to implement and sustain a trusted digital repository</li></ul><h3>Intended Audience</h3><p>The intended audience for this event is anyone involved in funding, supporting, developing, implementing, and/or managing digital repositories.</p><h3>Registration</h3><p>Registration fees are £30 for DCC Associates Network members and £60 for non-members. <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/drambora-belfast-2007/register">http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/drambora-belfast-2007/register</a></p><h3>Instructor</h3><p>Andrew McHugh, Advisory Services Manager for the DCC since 2004, leads a world-class team of digital curation practitioners in offering leading-edge expertise and insight in a range of issues.

This talk by the inventor of the term - Thomas Vander Wal - will offer you a chance to make your own judgment. The talk is open to all and will not require any specialist knowledge on behalf of the audience.</p><p>A Folksonomy can be created when users of 'Web 2.0' sites such as YouTube, Flickr, LastFM and Del.icio.us add keywords ('tags') to the items they view in order to add information about these items. As more and more users tags such items more information is created about the the items. Unlike library catalogues which are created by experts, folksonomies are like catalogues created by everyday people. For some, this heralds a brave new era of democratic information management, for others it heralds the death of expertise.</p><p>Thomas Vander Wal lives in Bethesda, Maryland, and this is a rare opportunity to hear him in the UK. He coined the term 'folksonomy' in 2004 and is a popular speaker on tagging/folksonomy, social Web, and Web applications around well structured information. He is principal, and senior consultant at InfoCloud Solutions, a social Web consulting firm. Thomas has been working professionally on the Web since 1995 (with a professional IT background beginning in 1988) and has breadth and depth across many roles and disciplines around Web design, social Web development &amp; research and general Web development. He is a member of the Web Standards Project Steering Committee and helped found the Information Architecture Institute and Boxes &amp; Arrows Web Magazine. See his Web site to find out more: <a href="http://www.vanderwal.net/">http://www.vanderwal.net/</a></p><p>The lecture is presented as part of the AHRC-funded research project Tags Networks Narratives, examining the interdisciplinary application of experimental social software to the study of narrative in digital contexts. It is a unique speculative project assessing the potential for collaborative social-software techniques such as folksonomy in narrative research. The project explores:</p><ul><li>What kinds of collaborative social network tools are available for the gathering and classification of information?</li><li>Which researchers are making online narratives the focus of study, and how are those projects categorised by discipline?</li><li>How can these researchers make effective use of social network tools to share knowledge and develop interdisciplinary collaborations?</li></ul><p>The project is based in the Institute of Creative Technologies (IOCT) at De Montfort University, Leicester UK and is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Board from October 2006-September 2007.

The conference is organised at the occasion of the retirement of Johan Steenbakkers, the KB's director of e-Strategy. Tools and Trends will feature international speakers who will present newest developments of Tools for digital preservation and the latest Trends in long-term archiving.</p><h3>The Programme</h3><p>Thursday 1 November will focus on Tools in digital preservation. To ensure future access to our digital heritage, long-term storage is just the first step. Acquisition, selection, appraisal, description, maintenance, retrieval and representation of digital objects are all aspects of the process of digital resource management. Organisations that have the responsibility for the curation of digital material need tools that allow them to set up their preservation workflow. Current projects are working on the development of these tools and procedures and will present their work at Tools and Trends. Sessions will focus on characterization of digital objects, on preservation action (migration, emulation) and preservation planning. Projects that will present their practical developments include PLANETS and CASPAR.</p><p>Friday 2 November will be dedicated to Trends in digital archiving. With enormous speed, all types of communication and information have become digital. Different digital collections require different forms of curation and may also require different preservation levels. Tools and Trends has invited international experts to answer the question: What are the latest trends in long-term preservation of web resources, e-publications, scientific data and archival records? And, looking forward: How can we set-up and maintain links between digital collections, what are the similarities and differences in preserving different kinds of digital materials and how do different sectors collaborate and divide responsibilities?</p><p>Everyone involved and interested in digital preservation is invited to participate in Tools and Trends.

The first phase of data enhancements has been carried out by OCLC PICA in response to feedback from users and the next phase is due to begin in summer 2007.</p><p>The data enhancement programme consists of three key strands. First, the data that was imported from the former UnityWeb service has been cleaned. Records have been de-duplicated, in one case, a single ISBN was present no less than 40 times. Furthermore, non-existing items were removed and (where necessary) data within each record has been moved to the appropriate MARC field. As a result of this project, in excess of 3,300,000 records have had their data made more consistent with MARC rules.</p><p>The second development strand integrates the catalogues and holdings information from the four main locations providing resources for the visually impaired. Inclusion of these catalogues brings a unique aspect to the UnityUK union catalogue. Data from the catalogues of the Royal National Institute for the Blind, National Library for the Blind, CALIBRE and The Torch Trust will be loaded into UnityUK.</p><p>Pat Beech, Manager RNIB National Library Service, explains the significance of the move, "Adding collection information from Revealweb to the Unity UK service is a real step forward for blind and partially sighted people as it will make it easier for them to use mainstream libraries. This project is an excellent example of what can be achieved when public libraries and the voluntary sector work together." Finally, the development programme addresses the quality and depth of holdings records within the service. Complete database loads have been carried out for around 70 UnityUK member libraries and 8 million high quality BL records, with holdings, will be loaded over the summer 2007.</p><p>For further information:</p><p>OCLC PICA <a href="http://www.oclcpica.org/">http://www.oclcpica.org/</a><br>UnityUK <a href="http://www.unity-uk.com/">http://www.unity-uk.com/</a><br>Revealweb <a href="http://www.revealweb.org.uk/">http://www.revealweb.org.uk/</a></p><p>[Source: TheAnswer Ltd/OCLC PICA]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: July 2007</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news7"></a></p><h3>MLA invites applications to 'Their Past Your Future 2'</h3><p>The Museums Libraries Archives (MLA) Partnership is launching an extension to the highly successful Big Lottery-funded 'Their Past Your Future' Programme.

Fedora Commons is a new non-profit organisation that will continue the mission of the Fedora Project, the successful open source software collaboration between Cornell University and the University of Virginia. The Fedora Project evolved from the Flexible Extensible Digital Object Repository Architecture (Fedora) developed by researchers at Cornell Computing and Information Science.</p><p>With this funding, Fedora Commons will foster an open community to support the development and deployment of open source software, which facilitates open collaboration and open access to scholarly, scientific, cultural, and educational materials in digital form. The software platform developed by Fedora Commons with Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation funding will support a networked model of intellectual activity, whereby scientists, scholars, teachers, and students will use the Internet to collaboratively create new ideas, and build on, annotate, and refine the ideas of their colleagues worldwide. With its roots in the Fedora open source repository system, developed since 2001 with support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the new software will continue to focus on the integrity and longevity of the intellectual products that underlie this new form of knowledge work. The result will be an open source software platform that both enables collaborative models of information creation and sharing, and provides sustainable repositories to secure the digital materials that constitute our intellectual, scientific, and cultural history.</p><p>Recognising the importance of multiple participants in the development of new technologies to support this vision, the Moore Foundation funding will also support the growth and diversification of the Fedora Community, a global set of partners who will co-operate in software development, application deployment, and community outreach for Fedora Commons. This network of partners will be instrumental in making Fedora Commons a self-sustainable non-profit organisation that will support and incubate open source software projects that focus on new mechanisms for information formation, access, collaboration, and preservation.</p><p>Fedora Commons <a href="http://www.fedora-commons.org">http://www.fedora-commons.org</a></p><p>[Source: Fedora Commons]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: August 2007</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p class="right"><a href="newsline.html#top"><small>Return to top</small></a></p><!-- this group of ssi's will work only when Ariadne 38 folder is in place with the relevant ssi files added --><p class="footer">Publication Date: 30-July-2007 Publication: Ariadne Issue 52<br>Originating URL: http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue52/newsline/</p>
