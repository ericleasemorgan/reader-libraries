In the last six years, there has been an unprecedented growth in the publishing of e-books with an increasing array of different types available for all sectors. The programme will give you the opportunity to explore a range of different e-books including a range of commercially-published and free reference works, monographs, textbooks, and fiction. Examples will include individual titles and also collections of e-books, such as those offered by NetLibrary and Oxford University Press. The course will also facilitate consideration of the new opportunities e-books offer for librarians and users, and the significant collection management and promotional issues which challenge information and library staff.</p><p>The course is designed to offer:</p><ul><li>an understanding of the meaning of the term 'e-book'</li><li>a familiarity with a range of commercially-produced e-book from publishers and aggregators</li><li>a familiarity with a range of free e-books</li><li>an understanding of the nature of e-books (e.g. reference, textbook)</li><li>an appreciation of the advantages and disadvantages of the medium</li><li>an appreciation of the collection management issues associated with bibliographical control, selection, acquisition, access, licensing, and archiving</li><li>a familiarity with the different ways of promoting awareness and use of the format</li></ul><p>In addition to talks by the presenters, the course includes two practical exercises. The first allows delegates to explore examples of online e-books in a structured way. The second comprises an activity in which delegates will be divided into small groups to examine the major collection management, and marketing and promotion issues. A plenary session led by the course presenters will then be held to enable delegates to discuss their findings in the light of current research, practice, and the work of the JISC e-Book Working Group.</p><p>To register your interest in this meeting, reserve a place, or request further details: please email <a href="mailto:cabaker@ukeig.org.uk">cabaker@ukeig.org.uk</a></p><p>ANLTC members should contact Miriam Corcoran, email <a href="mailto:miriam.corcoran@dcu.ie">miriam.corcoran@dcu.ie</a></p><h4>Further details:</h4><p>Available via the UKeiG Web site <a href="http://www.ukeig.org.uk/">http://www.ukeig.org.uk/</a> and the ANLTC Web site at <a href="http://www.anltc.ie/">http://www.anltc.ie/</a></p><p align="right"><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events2"></a></p><h3>Qualitative Archiving and Data Sharing Scheme (QUADS) Showcase Day 28 September 2006, Museum of London</h3><p>QUADS is the ESRC Qualitative Archiving and Data Sharing Scheme, running from April 2005 until October 2006. The aim of the scheme is to develop and promote innovative methodological approaches to the archiving, sharing, reuse and secondary analysis of qualitative research and data. A range of new models for increasing access to qualitative data resources, and for extending the reach and impact of qualitative studies will be explored. The scheme also aims to disseminate good practice in qualitative data sharing and research archiving. This is part of the ESRC's initiative to increase the UK resource of highly skilled researchers, and to exploit fully the distinctive potential offered by qualitative research and data.</p><p>QUADS is a small initiative and is dedicated to the mission of learning more about sharing, representation and reuse of qualitative data, in all of its disparate shapes and forms. Five small exploratory projects were funded together with a co-ordination role, run by ESDS Qualidata at Essex. The projects address both methodological, information and technical matters. Four common challenges were identified for the QUADS scheme: defining and capturing data context; audio-visual archiving; consent, confidentiality and IPR; and Web and metadata standards. Capturing degrees of context enables informed reuse of data. QUADS is devising and recommending a minimum set of contextual constructs that would be necessary to document a collection of qualitative data to enable informed secondary use. The methods of archiving and sharing digital audio-visual data from qualitative research are fairly new.</p><p>As many of the QUADS projects are handling these kinds of data, the scheme provided an opportunity to share expertise in presenting and reusing such sources. Consent, confidentiality and copyright perhaps provide the greatest challenges for reusing qualitative data and many the QUADS projects have addressed specific consent and copyright issues.</p><p>This one-day conference will showcase the demonstrators from the five projects and some additional partner projects that cover many of these cutting edge issues. Participants will have an opportunity to hear about the projects and the teams experiences, and see the Web sites and tools created by the projects. The projects afford unique case studies that can be used in the future to help inform those wishing to publish online and share qualitative data.</p><p>Further details including programme and booking: <a href="http://www.esds.ac.uk/qualidata/news/eventdetail.asp?ID=1588">http://www.esds.ac.uk/qualidata/news/eventdetail.asp?ID=1588</a></p><p align="right"><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events3"></a></p><h3>TASI announces Autumn workshops</h3><p>TASI (Technical Advisory Service for Images) has released details and dates for its forthcoming training programme.</p><p>Practical hands-on workshops running between September and December 2006 include:</p><ul><li>Digital Photography - Level 1</li><li>Rights and Responsibilities: Copyright and Digital Images</li><li>Rights and Responsibilities: Using Technology to Manage Rights in Digital Images</li><li>Image Capture (Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3)</li><li>Photoshop (Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3)</li><li>Introduction to Image Metadata</li><li>Building a Departmental Image Collection</li></ul><p>There are still places on the following workshops for September:</p><p>12 September 2006 - Image Capture Level 1</p><p>13 September 2006 - Image Capture Level 2</p><p>28 September 2006 - Image Capture Level 3</p><p>29 September 2006 - Introduction to Image Metadata</p><p>Full details of all our workshops and the online booking form can be found on TASI's Web site: <a href="http://www.tasi.ac.uk/training/">http://www.tasi.ac.uk/training/</a></p><p align="right"><br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events4"></a></p><h3>iPRES 2006 - The International Conference on the Preservation of Digital Objects</h3><p>The International Conference on the Preservation of Digital Objects (iPRES 2006) will be held over 8-10 October 2006 at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY U.S.A.</p><p>The theme of this year's iPRES is Words to Deeds: Collaboration in the Realm of Digital Preservation.

Surveys have found serious shortages of trained staff and equipment, and an even more serious shortage of concerted preservation actions. The immediate needs are: awareness - and help.</p><p>This one-day course will provide basic information on the problems of audiovisual material, what to do about them - and where to get help and more information. The targets are culture, heritage and academic collections, to focus on a group of people and collections with broadly similar issues and solutions.</p><p>Fee: £60 includes lunch for non-profit making organisations (VAT will not be charged) or £180 (plus VAT) for the corporate sector (who will be allocated any remaining places not taken).</p><p>Early registration is advised, as numbers will be limited to approximately 25 persons.

Issues surrounding creative industries, technology and new media together with discussions about Intellectual Property Rights are being played out at the highest political levels and the landscape has the potential to be reshaped dramatically. Cultural heritage organisations need to embrace these developments and position themselves to ensure that they are represented as a sector that provides cultural content, free at the point of access, whilst looking to the rights that they own themselves to develop models to sustain their core activities and achieve high levels of service to their commercial users. This conference will provide an exciting forum to simulate debate and discussion about these key areas with suppliers and users of cultural content set within one of the foremost collections of art in the world.</p><p>Programme: <a href="http://www.kdcs.kcl.ac.uk/mcg2007/programme.htm">http://www.kdcs.kcl.ac.uk/mcg2007/programme.htm</a></p><p>Registration for the conference has now opened at: <a href="http://www.kdcs.kcl.ac.uk/mcg2007/registration.htm">http://www.kdcs.kcl.ac.uk/mcg2007/registration.htm</a></p><p align="right"><br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><a name="news1"></a></p><h3>The MLA releases its 2004-2006 review</h3><p>MLA's biennial review of activities between April 2004 and end of March 2006.

There is no need to download or configure extensions or plugins.</p><h4>OpenSearch Discovery</h4><p>OJAX now supports OpenSearch Discovery. When users visit any OJAX repository search page, their browser will automatically detect that the repository can be searched via OpenSearch and will offer to add the repository to the set of search plugins installed in their browser.</p><p>Once added, OJAX can be selected in the browser search bar and repository searches can be performed at any time without having to navigate back to the repository search page.</p><h4>Search Suggestions (Auto-Completion)</h4><p>Firefox 2.0 has extended the OpenSearch protocol to allow auto-completion in the browser search bar (which Firefox calls "Search Suggestions"). OJAX is one of the first search engines to implement the server side of this extended OpenSearch protocol, after Google, Yahoo! and Answers.com. It is arguably the first open source search engine to do so.</p><p>Because OJAX 0.6 uses the increasingly popular OpenSearch 1.1 search descriptions, the new features described above require the latest versions of the two major browsers: Firefox 2.0 or Internet Explorer 7.0.</p><p>Fof further information, demo and download see: <a href="http://ojax.sourceforge.net/">http://ojax.sourceforge.net/</a></p><p>[Source: Dr Judith Wusteman, School of Information and Library Studies, University College Dublin]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: August 2006</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p class="right"><a href="newsline.html#top"><small>Return to top</small></a></p><!-- this group of ssi's will work only when Ariadne 38 folder is in place with the relevant ssi files added --><p class="footer">Publication Date: 30-July-2006 Publication: Ariadne Issue 48<br>Originating URL: http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue48/newsline/</p>
