Hoebelheinrich and Rick Beaubien of the METS Editorial Board. This workshop is aimed at people who work in digital and physical libraries and would like to gain knowledge and skills to organise the many and disparate component parts of individual digital resources.</p><p>The Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) is a data encoding and transmission specification, expressed in XML, that provides a means for conveying the structural, descriptive, and administrative metadata necessary for both the management of digital objects within a repository and the exchange of such objects between repositories (or between repositories and their users). This common digital object format was designed to facilitate both the exchange of digital materials among institutions and vendors, and the shared development of supporting tools. METS is currently used by libraries and cultural heritage institutions worldwide including the Library of Congress, the British Library, the German National Library, the Ministry of Culture Spain, the National Diet Library Japan, the National Library of Finland, the National Library of Portugal, the National Library of Wales and numerous research libraries across the globe.</p><p>Although continuous, this hands-on workshop consists of three modules, any of which may be taken independently.</p><ul><li>Module 1: An Overview of METS â€“ offers a thorough introduction to METS including an overview of all of its high level features. (Duration: one day).</li><li>Module 2: Strategies for encoding various content types â€“ delves deeply into the heart of METS: the flexible mechanisms it provides for encoding, organizing and representing digital content of various kinds and for different purposes. (Duration: two days).</li><li>Module 3: Strategies for implementing METS in a production environment â€“ explores strategies for implementing METS in a production environment, and reviews existing tools that can facilitate implementation. (Duration: two days).</li></ul><p><strong>For further information:</strong><br>For further details, including expanded module descriptions, instructor bios, and information on lodging, please go to:<br><a href="http://www.arl.org/stats/statsevents/METS-workshop.shtml">http://www.arl.org/stats/statsevents/METS-workshop.shtml</a></p><h4>Instructors:</h4><ul><li>Nancy J.

Undertaken by the University of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Institute for the Study of Science, Technology and Innovation, the UK Digital Curation Centre and the University of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Information Services, the report concludes that &lsquo;one-size-fits-all&rsquo; information and data sharing policies are not achieving scientifically productive and cost-efficient information use in life sciences.</p><p>The report, <em>Patterns of Information Use and Exchange: Case Studies of Researchers in Life Sciences</em> was developed using an innovative approach to capture the day-to-day patterns of information use in seven research teams across a wide range of disciplines, from botany to clinical neuroscience. The study, undertaken over 11 months and involving 56 participants, found that there is a significant gap between how researchers behave and the policies and strategies of funders and service providers. This suggests that the attempts to implement such strategies have had only a limited impact. Key findings from the report include:</p><ul><li>Researchers use informal and trusted sources of advice from colleagues, rather than institutional service teams, to help identify information sources and resources</li><li>The use of social networking tools for scientific research purposes is far more limited than expected</li><li>Data and information sharing activities are mainly driven by needs and benefits perceived as most important by life scientists rather than &lsquo;top-down&rsquo; policies and strategies</li><li>There are marked differences in the patterns of information use and exchange between research groups active in different areas of the life sciences, reinforcing the need to avoid standardised policy approaches</li></ul><p>The study used ground-breaking research methods to map information use in research teams from across the life sciences. This included specially designed &lsquo;information lab books&rsquo; to chart and monitor individual researchers&rsquo; day-to-day information practices.</p><p>The report sets out a number of recommendations to funders, universities and information service providers on how policy and services can be more aligned with research practice and help UK life scientists sustain their position at the forefront of world-class research.</p><p><strong>Further information:</strong><br><br><strong>Research Information Network:</strong><br><em>Patterns of information use and exchange: case studies of researchers in the life sciences</em><br><a href="http://www.rin.ac.uk/our-work/using-and-accessing-information-resources/disciplinary-case-studies-life-sciences">http://www.rin.ac.uk/our-work/using-and-accessing-information-resources/disciplinary-case-studies-life-sciences</a></p><p>[Source: British Library]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: November 2009</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news6"></a></p><h3>UKOLN Research Officer Wins Remote Worker Award 2009</h3><p>UKOLN Research Officer Marieke Guy, who works entirely from home, was surprised to discover that she has won the Remote Worker Award organised by <a href="http://www.remoteemployment.com/">Remote Employment</a> in association with <a href="http://business.bt.com/">BT Business</a>. Marieke had already been named on the short list to win but was facing some very strong competition.

I want to thank my employers UKOLN and the University of Bath who have endorsed the work I do and encouraged me throughout.&rdquo;</p><p>With typical modesty Marieke only informed colleagues of her award obliquely by pointing them to the address of her popular blog on remote working <a href="http://remoteworker.wordpress.com/">Ramblings of a Remote Worker</a> which operates at the core of her work in this area. Dr.Liz Lyon, Director of UKOLN, who had encouraged Marieke to follow her path to remote working was asked for her reaction. &ldquo;I think I speak for all my colleagues when I say how delighted I am to see Marieke receive this award as a fitting tribute to all her hard work in this area. Both before and since her appointment as Remote Worker Champion at UKOLN in 2008, Marieke has worked tirelessly to refine our remote working systems as well as represent her colleagues who also work entirely online to us. Moreover, as Marieke has pointed out herself, this award also recognises the efforts of colleagues, for example in Software &amp; Systems, and elsewhere in UKOLN, who have played their part to further a new approach to working from which we all benefit.&rdquo;</p><p>Marieke has also written a number of contributions to <em>Ariadne</em> on the topic of remote working.</p><p><strong>Further information:</strong><br>Marieke Guy, UKOLN<br><a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/ukoln/staff/m.guy/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/ukoln/staff/m.guy/</a></p><p>Marieke&rsquo;s blog Ramblings of a Remote Worker<br><a href="http://remoteworker.wordpress.com/">http://remoteworker.wordpress.com/</a></p><p>Marieke&rsquo;s contributions to <em>Ariadne</em> on remote working:</p><p>Article Title: &ldquo;A Desk Too Far?: The Case for Remote Working&rdquo;<br>Author: Marieke Guy<br>Publication Date: 30 July 2008<br>Publication: <em>Ariadne</em> Issue 56<br>Originating URL: <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue56/guy/">http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue56/guy/</a></p><p>Article Title: &ldquo;Staying Connected: Technologies Supporting Remote Workers&rdquo;<br>Author: Marieke Guy<br>Publication Date: 30 October 2008<br>Publication: <em>Ariadne</em> Issue 57<br>Originating URL: <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue57/guy/">http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue57/guy/</a></p><p>Article Title: &ldquo;A Support Framework for Remote Workers&rdquo;<br>Author: Marieke Guy<br>Publication Date: 30 April 2009<br>Publication: <em>Ariadne</em> Issue 59<br>Originating URL: <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue59/guy/">http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue59/guy/</a></p><p>[Source: UKOLN]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: September 2009</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news7"></a></p><h3>Erasmus Prize for Europeana</h3><p>Europeana.eu has been awarded the Erasmus Award for Networking Europe at the Erasmus EuroMedia Awards 2009 ceremony at the City Hall in Vienna.</p><p>There were some 230 applications, resulting in 62 nominations, from which the jury selected 3 Erasmus awards.

The MLA is writing to all local authority chief executives in England emphasising how public libraries make a difference by supporting people and communities in learning, acquiring new skills and jobs, accessing the Internet and reading books.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.mla.gov.uk/librarysupport">MLA Web site guidance</a> highlights case studies from Leicester, Lincolnshire, Newcastle, Staffordshire, Suffolk and Wigan illustrating how these library services have improved their services by redefining strategic priorities, restructuring the workforce, community consultation and co-location with other services.</p><p>MLA Chief Executive Roy Clare said, &ldquo;The MLA is looking forward to continuing to support the cause of better library services for people and communities everywhere. We don&rsquo;t have a mandate to intervene, but the MLA field teams can respond quickly and effectively when local authorities seek guidance and help, plus there is a wealth of case studies, research and evidence available on our Web site.&rdquo;</p><p>President of the Society of Chief Librarians (SCL), Fiona Williams, said, &ldquo;These library support pages were developed following consultations that MLA had with SCL and the library sector. They will be a very useful resource for those delivering a library service that works for every community.
