Booking closes on 3 March 2004.</p><p>AUDIENCE: UK Slide Librarians in HE and those responsible for visual collections</p><p>"Higher education in the UK has always needed images, especially in the field of art and design, and institutions have built up their own slide libraries to service that demand. Latterly, however, it is digital images that are being sought by lecturers and students and numerous products are being produced to accommodate this need. Slide librarians need to educate themselves about these new products and update their skills so that they can continue to ensure that their specialist knowledge of image use at higher education level is applied by the new developers".</p><p>Jenny Godfrey (2004)</p><p>[January 2004]</p><p><a name="2"></a></p><h2>The proposed OpenURL Framework Standard goes to ballot</h2><p>Eric Van de Velde reports that NISO Committee AX has delivered the proposed OpenURL Framework Standard to NISO headquarters.</p><p>The documents can be found on the Web site of NISO Committee AX at: <a href="http://library.caltech.edu/openurl/Standard.htm"> http://library.caltech.edu/openurl/Standard.htm </a></p><p>NISO will hold a ballot among its membership according to its established procedures.

For more information see <a href="http://openurl.ac.uk/doc">http://openurl.ac.uk/doc</a></p><p>The OpenURL Router is sponsored by the JISC and administered by EDINA in association with UKOLN. The Router is provided to all HE and FE institutions in the UK, with the aim of:</p><ul><li>Helping institutions with OpenURL Resolvers to establish OpenURL links from a wider range of services.</li><li>Enabling providers of OpenURL aware services to link to the appropriate OpenURL Resolver for each of their end users.</li><li>Extending the range of services in which OpenURL links can usefully be deployed.</li></ul><p>The OpenURL Router works by offering a central registry of institutions' OpenURL resolvers. An institution registers details of its resolver just once, at openurl.ac.uk. When the resolver has been registered at openurl.ac.uk, any service provider can provide users from that institution with OpenURL links to their resolver.</p><p>Any queries on the above to be mailed to EDINA support at <a href="mailto:helpdesk@openurl.ac.uk">helpdesk@openurl.ac.uk</a></p><p>[January 2004]</p><p><a name="4"></a></p><h2>The 10th INFORUM Conference on Professional Information Resources</h2><p>2004, May 25 - 27, 2004, Prague (Czech Republic) <a href="http://www.inforum.cz/"> http://www.inforum.cz/ </a>, <a href="http://www.inforum.cz/english"> http://www.inforum.cz/english </a></p><p>The three-day conference, which is focused on variety of aspects concerning use of electronic information resources in research, development, education and business, will be attended by information specialists from public and special libraries, the corporate sector and government agencies.

ECDL has become the major European Forum focusing on digital libraries and associated technical, organisational and social issues.</p><p>Digital library research brings together a number of disciplines and practitioner communities, providing an environment for debate and an opportunity for establishing collaboration. ECDL provides a forum for the exchange of ideas between scientific disciplines and fosters joint initiatives with application communities. Involvement of researchers and practitioners from computing and information science disciplines is well established at ECDL. Increasingly these disciplines are engaging in discussion and co-operation with other groups concerned with knowledge management. ECDL 2004 encourages involvement from a wide range of disciplines and looks forward to increasing contributions from usability experts, educationalists, developers of eLearning systems, and by working within the eScience and GRID communities. The continued success of ECDL rests on the exchange of ideas and experience between these groups.</p><p>ECDL 2004 welcomes contributions and participation from scholars, researchers, practitioners and policy makers across the range of disciplines related to the development of the digital library in its widest sense.</p><h3>IMPORTANT DATES</h3><p>5 April 2004: Papers, panels, tutorials and workshops submissions due.<br>19 May 2004: Poster and demonstration submissions due.<br>11 June 2004: Final submission date.</p><p>[January 2004]</p><p><a name="6"></a></p><h2>ePrints UK Workshops</h2><p><a href="http://www.rdn.ac.uk/projects/eprints-uk/">ePrints UK</a> Workshops In the next few months ePrints UK Project will be running a series of workshops providing an introduction to eprints and institutional repositories and the issues surrounding them.

We intend to load information on about 450 products over the next few months and we encourage software developers and others to be proactive in providing information via our online submission form.

The collection will also include a selection of new education journals and will incorporate 20 of the journals already available in the Business Collection. Arts &amp; Sciences IV will not contain the 26 other Business Collection journals that are available through Arts &amp; Sciences I and II. When complete, the collection will comprise a minimum of 100 journals to be released between 2004 and 2006.</p><p>For further information on these new collections, including pricing information, please see <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/jstor.html"> http://www.jisc.ac.uk/jstor.html </a>.</p><p>[January 2004]</p><p><a name="9"></a></p><h2>Announcement of Web Service Resource Framework</h2><p>Dr Daniel Sabbah, Vice President, Software Development, Strategy and Architecture at IBM, on behalf of IBM and the Globus Alliance, announced proposals for a collection of web service standards that provide conventions for handling stateful resources, e.g., file systems, databases and long-running programs, within the preferred service-oriented architecture of web services. This neatly addresses the requirements of large-scale and long-running systems typical of grid computing while retaining the style of web services favoured by industry.</p><p>The announcement was made at Globus World (<a href="http://www.globusworld.org/"> http://www.globusworld.org/ </a>) in San Francisco. More information can be found at <a href="http://www.globus.org/wsrf/"> http://www.globus.org/wsrf/ </a></p><p>Professor Tony Hey, Director of the UK e-Science Core Programme said,</p><p><em>"The proposed WSRF standards are a very welcome step as they bring the web services and grid communities into closer alignment. This will lead to increased synergy with commercial middleware development that will be of significant value to research communities. In this emerging framework the UK is expected to continue to play a leading role in developing standards and their implementations."</em></p><p>Prof Malcolm Atkinson Director of the National e-Science Centre said,</p><p><em>"These proposed standards are a very valuable and a much needed step in the integration of web service and grid approaches to large scale distributed systems. I'm delighted to see that they provide an effective framework for handling stateful components which are essential for grids, computational steering and distributed data management. Many European organisations rely on the Globus Toolkit and we are pleased to be at the vanguard of developments which will deliver much greater synergy between commerce and research."</em></p><p>[January 2004]</p><p><a name="10"></a></p><h2>UKOLN Public Library Web Managers workshop 2004: Beyond the Web site</h2><p>UKOLN will be holding another of its popular public library web managers workshops in May this year.
