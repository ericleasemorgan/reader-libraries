In addition, recently two progressive encoding techniques, RDFa and microformats, have emerged to overlay additional semantics onto valid XHTML documents. While this breadth of expression is quite liberating, it can prove to be a barrier to understanding across different domains or fields.</p><p>GRDDL is a mechanism for Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages; that is, for extracting RDF data from XML documents by way of transformation algorithms, typically represented in XSLT and usually producing RDF/XML documents.</p><p>This note collects a number of motivating use cases together with their goals and requirements for extracting RDF data from XML documents.</p><p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/NOTE-grddl-scenarios-20070406/">http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/NOTE-grddl-scenarios-20070406/</a></p><p>[Source: Dr. Fabien Lucien Gandon, INRIA]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: April 2007</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news2"></a></p><h3>Blueprint for Excellence: Public Libraries 2008-2011</h3><p>In a recent announcement the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) stated it regarded the discussion paper Blueprint for Excellence as an invitation to professionals to become involved in the forward thinking and planning for libraries in the years ahead.

The scheme aims to encourage museums and galleries which house permanent collections to work with contemporary arts organisations which do not. Up to five projects will be selected in 2007 and will be allocated funding to spend over the next five years.</p><p>The application process is in two stages. In the first stage, the Fund will be inviting Expressions of Interest from institutions which wish to participate in the scheme. The deadline for submitting Expressions of Interest is noon, Friday 22 June 2007 but any institution wishing to participate is asked to contact The Art Fund as soon as possible.</p><p>See The Art Fund's Web site for more information on how to apply: <a href="http://www.artfund.org/grants/artfundinternational.html">http://www.artfund.org/grants/artfundinternational.html</a></p><p>[Source:MLA]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: April 2007</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news6"></a></p><h3>New Look for UnityUK</h3><p>On 2 April 2007 The Combined Regions (TCR), in partnership with OCLC PICA, went live with the next version of the UnityUK resource sharing service. The new version delivers significant enhancements in workflow and usability and has been developed in partnership with the service's user community of over 120 libraries.</p><p>The new features have been designed to enhance the system in line with the needs of its users. It has been developed in response to comments and suggestions gathered from numerous discussions, workshops, user groups and surveys with the user community during the 12 months since the service went live, and also from the outcome of the LinkUK integration project. This is the first major release for the service, which is part-financed by the European Union's European Regional Development Fund delivered through the South Yorkshire Objective 1 Programme.</p><p>The new developments are designed to deliver significant enhancements in two key areas. Firstly, the workflow through the requesting process has been simplified which will make the service easier and quicker to use. Secondly, the introduction of a new facility that enables UnityUK members and non UnityUK libraries to manage responses through the service. This new feature removes the need for individual email responses to be updated manually.</p><p>All the information that users need in order to make the best of the new release is easily available via the UnityUK Members' Area Web site, which is free to members. For the first time, users will be able to download short training films which demonstrate the key features of the new version.</p><p>OCLC PICA, in conjunction with the UnityUK user community, is planning further new developments for release later in 2007. Ideas currently under discussion include the integration of fee management in to the service and an end-to-end improvement in the interface and workflow with the British Library.</p><p><strong>For further information:</strong><br>See <a href="http://www.combinedregions.com/">http://www.combinedregions.com/</a> or contact <a href="mailto:k.birch@oclcpica.org">k.birch@oclcpica.org</a></p><p>[Source: TheAnswer Ltd]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: April 2007</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><p class="right"><a href="newsline.html#top"><small>Return to top</small></a></p><p class="footer">Publication Date: 30-April-2007 Publication: Ariadne Issue 51<br>Originating URL: http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue51/newsline/</p>
