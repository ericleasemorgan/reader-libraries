This event will be held over one and a half days at the Campus Adlershof, Humboldt University in Berlin on 27-28 November 2007. This event is being organised as a follow-up to the 2005 DCC workshop on long-term curation within digital repositories which was held in Cambridge, UK.</p><p>Scientific and scholarly content such as articles and data are increasingly deposited in institutional and subject-based repositories. These developments pose practical, conceptual and organisational challenges for accessing these contents now and in a future-proof manner. The long-term survival, value and usability of the information stored within digital repositories depends on numerous criteria such as the formats selected for storage, the capture of associated metadata, proactive preservation measures, and the perceived trust in the repository itself. This workshop will highlight current practices and shall provide insights into current initiatives and technical systems being developed.</p><h3>Format</h3><p>The workshop will be delivered over six sessions and will cover the following areas:</p><ul><li>Technical Infrastructure and Social Support Frameworks</li><li>Selection, Appraisal, Ingest and Description</li><li>Operational Activity within the Repository</li><li>Preservation Activity within the Repository</li><li>Discovery and Access</li><li>Quality Control, Self-audit and Certification</li></ul><p>Each session will be chaired by a leading expert on the topic. The chair will begin the session by placing the topic in the context of digital curation and provide references to international efforts in the area. Following this introduction, each presentations will highlight specific tools, practical approaches and emerging standards. Each session will conclude with an open question period which will be moderated by the session chair.</p><p>Key themes include:</p><ul><li>Tools to help select, appraise and ingest information into digital repositories</li><li>Description techniques that may help to ensure the long-term usability of digital information including the automation of metadata capture</li><li>Overview of preservation activities being undertaken internationally and also practical applications of preservation processes</li><li>Making certification of repositories meaningful and effective</li></ul><p align="right"><br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events4"></a></p><h3>ONLINE EDUCA BERLIN</h3><p>13th International Conference on Technology Supported Learning and Training<br>28-30 November 2007<br>Hotel InterContinental Berlin, Budapester Str. 2, D-10787 Berlin, Germany<br><a href="http://www.online-educa.com">http://www.online-educa.com</a></p><p>This conference aims to meet the networking needs of the international e-learning and distance education industry.

The surveys were conducted in English, German, French and Japanese. 382 U.S. library directors were also surveyed.</p><p>Among the report highlights:</p><ul><li>The Internet is familiar territory. 89% of respondents have been online for four years or more and nearly a quarter have been using the Internet for more than 10 years.</li><li>The Web community has migrated from using the Internet to building it - the Internet&rsquo;s readers are rapidly becoming its authors.</li><li>More than a quarter of the general public respondents currently participate on some type of social media or social networking site; half of college students use social sites.</li><li>On social networking sites, 39 % have shared information about a book they have read, 57 percent have shared photos/videos and 14 % have shared self-published information.</li><li>Over half of respondents surveyed feel their personal information on the Internet is kept as private, or more private, than it was two years ago.</li><li>Online trust increases with usage. 70% of social networking users indicate they always, often or sometimes trust who they communicate with on social networking sites.</li><li>Respondents do not distinguish library Web sites as more private than other sites they are using.</li><li>13% of the public feels it is the role of the library to create a social networking site for their communities.</li></ul><p>Cathy De Rosa, Global Vice President of Marketing, OCLC, and principal contributor to the report said she hoped the new report would spark discussion and interest in libraries and among library professionals. Ms. De Rosa will be speaking about the study and its findings at a symposium at London Online which OCLC is hosting for the first time outside the US.

With these components Dioscuri successfully runs 16-bit operating systems like MS-DOS and applications such as WordPerfect 5.1, DrawPerfect 1.1 and Norton Commander. Furthermore, it is capable of running many nostalgic DOS-games and a simple Linux kernel. And when you finally open your long-forgotten WP5.1-files you can extract the text from the emulated environment into your current working environment using a simple clipboard-feature.</p><h3>Designed for digital preservation:</h3><p>Dioscuri is built on top of a virtual layer, called a virtual machine (VM) thereby reducing dependence on the actual hardware and software it runs on. This approach offers better portability to other platforms, which ensures longevity when a platform fails to survive over time.</p><p>Flexibility is gained by a component-based architecture. Each component, or module, imitates the functionality of a particular hardware component (i.e. processor, memory, hard disk, etc.). By combining these modules any computer emulation can be created. Configuring Dioscuri is done by a user-friendly graphical interface which stores the settings in an XML file.</p><p>Next steps are already in progress. Since July 2007 development of Dioscuri has continued under the umbrella of the European project Planets. Future work will consist of extending Dioscuri with more components to emulate newer x86 computers (286, 386, 486 and Pentium) which will make Dioscuri capable of running operating systems like MS Windows 95/98/2000/XP and Linux Ubuntu.</p><p>Dioscuri version 0.2.0 is now available as open source software for any institution or individual wishing to see their old digital documents again.

Seventy senior managers and technical experts from museums, archives, audio-visual collections and libraries across Europe came together to plan the European Digital Library. The meeting took place at the National Library of the Netherlands.</p><p>The initiative stems from the call by Viviane Reding, the European Commissioner for Information Society and Media to &lsquo;make the wealth of material in Europe&rsquo;s libraries, museums and archives accessible to all&rsquo;.</p><p>This reflects growing user interest in major digitisation projects that are creating large-scale online heritage resources. However, this is the first initiative to focus on providing a multilingual interface to digital artefacts, texts and media from across the European heritage.</p><p>Such collaboration between the archival, library, audio-visual and museum domains on this scale is a significant new move. Claudia Dillmann, director of the Deutsches Filminstitut and President of the Association des Cinémathèques Européennes said &lsquo;We recognise that researchers and people learning about European history and culture need to explore all sorts of media, including films, sounds, photos and papers. Their expectation of the internet is that it can give them integrated access to all these things. It&rsquo;s vital that the different domains work together to collaborate on the technical solutions to enable research across different media.&rsquo;</p><p>The project - the European Digital Library network (EDLnet) - runs for two years, and will develop a prototype that demonstrates proof of concept, bringing together content from some of Europe&rsquo;s major cultural organisations. The project will be run by The European Library together with the National Library of the Netherlands.</p><p>The project will look at the political, human, technical and semantic issues that will contribute to the creation of an interoperable system able to access fully digitised content. It will invite feedback from different types of users in order to create a service that enriches the widest public and answers the needs of researchers, students, teachers and the creative industries.</p><h3>Further information:</h3><p>EDLnet <a href="http://www.europeandigitallibrary.eu/edlnet/">http://www.europeandigitallibrary.eu/edlnet/</a></p><p>[Source: The European Library]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: October 2007</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p class="right"><a href="newsline.html#top"><small>Return to top</small></a></p><!-- this group of ssi's will work only when Ariadne 38 folder is in place with the relevant ssi files added --><p class="footer">Publication Date: 30-October-2007 Publication: Ariadne Issue 53<br>Originating URL: <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue53/newsline/">http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue53/newsline/</a></p></p>
