University libraries are thus exercising their core competence towards guaranteeing the future by supporting studies and science with the provision of specific information services and creating the fundamental pre-requisite for the work carried out there.</p><p>The aim of the Symposium is to discuss methods on how to handle subject-specific content efficiently, in order to ensure essential media competency in all areas of science and industry. At the heart of the discussion should be the specific role of the librarian which, in comparison with other sectors in information management, is not a closed book yet.</p><p>This year&rsquo;s Symposium seeks to clarify the role of libraries and colleagues in the changing world of information management.</p><p>Dr. Andreas Werner: <a href="mailto:werner@stub.uni-frankfurt.de">werner@stub.uni-frankfurt.de</a>, Tel.: (069) 212-39-355</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: July 2004</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events6"></a></p><h3>EURBICA Conference on the DTDs EAD (Encoded Archival Description) and EAC (Encoded Archival Context), : 7 and 8 October 2004, Paris</h3><p>Following the seminar held 2 years ago in the conference room of the National Library of France, (on the application of the EAD DTD for cultural heritage purposes in archives and in libraries), the Directorate of the Archives of France is organising a European Conference on 7th and 8th October 2004 on data-processing software for encoding research aids for archives and authority data into XML (Extensible Markup Language). The last European Conference on the subject took place at the Public Record Office in Kew, in October 1999.</p><p>Since 2001 another DTD, EAC (Encoded Archival Context), has been developed simultaneously. Perfectly compatible with the International Standard Archival Authority Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families ISAAR(CPF), and complementary to the UNIMARC/Authorities format, the EAC combines bibliographic authority records and archival authority records, which give information both about the creator and the context of creation of archival material. The Beta version of EAC Tag Library should shortly become available.</p><p>Tests have been done on the conversion of authority data into EAC/XML format, in particular within the LEAF project (Linking and Exploring Authority Files): local authority data will be downloaded from the local servers of the participating organisations to a central system which links automatically the authorities belonging to the same entity.</p><p>The participants will present their research results and ideas on different issues:</p><ul><li>what is required for EAD implementation : thoughts on standardisation, training;</li><li>EAD implementation : tools for creating EAD documents, interoperability, compatibility with other standards;</li><li>publishing EAD/XML documents : editing tools, documentary management applications with documents stored on a Web server in native XML;</li><li>the EAC DTD and the first examples of authority records encoded into XML.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The European seminar will be held at the conference room of the Musée national des Arts et Traditions Populaires (MNATP), 6 avenue du Mahatma Gandhi, 75016 Paris</p><p>There will be translation in English and French.</p><p>The registration is free.

CWIS was specifically created to help build collections of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) resources and connect them into NSF&rsquo;s National Science Digital Library, but can be (and is being) used for a wide variety of other purposes.</p><p>A few of the features of CWIS include:</p><ul><li>prepackaged taxonomies</li><li>user-definable metadata schema</li><li>recommender system</li><li>keyword and fielded search engine</li><li>resource annotations and ratings</li></ul><p>CWIS requires a Web server that supports PHP and MySQL.

The digitised content will be made freely available on the Internet - via PubMed Central and augment the content already available there.</p><p>With funding of £1.25 million (£750,000 from the Trust, £500,000 from the JISC) the project plans to digitise around 1.7 million pages of text. The NLM will manage the project, host the archive and ensure that the digital files are preserved in perpetuity.</p><p>The list of journals to be digitised will include the Annals of Surgery, Biochemical Journal, Journal of Physiology and Medical History. Digitisation will commence in Summer 2004 and the first titles will be online early in 2005.</p><p>In addition to creating a digital copy of every page in the backfiles, the digitisation process will also create a PDF file for every discrete item (article, editorial, letter, advertisements etc.) in the archive, and use optical character recognition (OCR) technology to generate searchable text.</p><p>Although the project focuses on digitising backfiles, publishers will also include new issues of the selected journals on an ongoing basis subject to an embargo period, as defined by each participating publisher.</p><p>The Medical Journals Backfiles Digitisation Project is one of six digitisation projects with funding for the Higher Education Funding Council (HEFCE). The overall programme, being managed by JISC, represents a total investment of some £10m to be applied to delivering high quality content online, including sound, moving pictures, census data and still images for long-term use by the further and higher education communities in the UK.</p><p>Further information about this project can be found at <a href="http://library.wellcome.ac.uk/node280.html">http://library.wellcome.ac.uk/node280.html</a></p><p align="right">[<em>Received: 28 June 2004</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news5"></a></p><h3>Results Available from the Gabriel/The European Library User Survey</h3><p>Results of a survey among the users of the Gabriel Web Service (<a href="http://www.kb.nl/gabriel/">http://www.kb.nl/gabriel/</a>) are now available.

It will be launched at the beginning of 2005. Gabriel will be incorporated into The European Library and will therefore disappear as a separate Web service.</p><h3>Aims of the User Survey</h3><p>This survey was designed to obtain a better profile of the users of Gabriel and their future needs. The users of Gabriel are considered an important target group for The European Library. In total 560 people from across Europe responded to the questionnaire.</p><p>This report gives insight into the background of the respondents (e.g. age, education), their use of the Internet, their use of the Gabriel Web site and their opinions of the site. The respondents were also asked if they would use a shared catalogue of all the national libraries in Europe if that were to be created.</p><p><strong>Further information:</strong></p><p>Gabriel Web site: <a href="http://www.kb.nl/gabriel/">http://www.kb.nl/gabriel/</a><br>Or contact :<br>Olaf Janssen, Gabriel Editor<br>Koninklijke Bibliotheek - National Library of the Netherlands<br><a href="mailto:olaf.janssen@kb.nl">olaf.janssen@kb.nl</a></p><p align="right">[<em>Received: 7 July 2004</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news6"></a></p><h3>Three New Open Access / OAI Articles and Reports</h3><p>Gerry McKiernan, Associate Professor and Science and Technology Librarian and Bibliographer at Iowa State University Library announced the availability of three major publications relating to Open Access and the Open Archives Initiative:</p><p>[I] &ldquo;Open Archives Initiative Data Providers.
