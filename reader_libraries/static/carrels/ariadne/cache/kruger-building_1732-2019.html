This article looks at the possibility to develop a Digital Scholarship Centre on the foundation of a successful Library Makerspace. The University of Pretoria Library Makerspace is the first known Academic Makerspace in a university library on the African continent. The origin of Digital Scholarship in general and Digital Scholarship Centres in libraries are discussed. The overlap in functions of a Makerspace and a Digital Scholarship Centre is also illustrated. By combining the Library Makerspace services with that of a Digital Scholarship Centre, a comprehensive Digital Scholarship Centre in the Library can be established.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The 2017 Library Edition of the well-known Horizon Report (<a href="pienaar-et-all.html#nmc-horizon-report2017">NMC Horizon
report, 2017</a>) describes ‘Digital Scholarship Technologies’ as one of
the important developments in technology for Academic and Research
Libraries. According to the report “The concept of digital scholarship
has origins in the late 1990s in the United Kingdom. Originally
referred to as e-science, the idea of applying new technology and data
analysis tools to scholarship cycled through other names like
cyber-infrastructure and e-scholarship, before landing on the current
umbrella term. This umbrella term comprises several information
technologies including high performance computing, visualisation
technologies, database technologies, and high-performance
networking. Thus, digital scholarship has ushered in a new paradigm of
data-intensive science. Academic libraries were quick to position
themselves as incubators for this transformation of research, by
developing shared virtual and physical places for fostering scholarly
inquiry. The physical spaces are known as digital scholarship
centres”. In addition, the report also highlights that “The Consortium
of Networked Information (CNI) characterizes these spaces as being
placed in academic libraries rather than faculty-run institutes,
focused on digital humanities, and cross-disciplinary in nature”. Some
of these digital scholarship centres e.g. McMaster University, Canada,
were initially grounded in the humanities, but has developed a
Makerspace later on as part of their digital scholarship offering (<a
href="pienaar-et-all.html#lippincott-et-al2014">Lippincott et al, 2014</a>). In South
Africa digital humanities is a recent development and still in its
infancy.</p>

<p>According to the SpeckKit 350: Supporting Digital Scholarship (<a
href="pienaar-et-all.html#mulligan2016">Mulligan, 2016</a>), published by the Association
for Research Libraries 19 Digital Scholarship activities have been
identified by participating institutions. These activities are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>GIS and digital Mapping</p></li>

<li><p>Digitisation / imaging of analogue material</p></li>

<li><p>Making digital collections</p></li>

<li><p>Metadata creation</p></li>

<li><p>Digital Preservation</p></li>

<li><p>Data curation and management</p></li>

<li><p>3-D modelling and printing</p></li>

<li><p>Statistical analysis / support</p></li>

<li><p>Digital exhibits</p></li>

<li><p>Project planning</p></li>

<li><p>Digital publishing</p></li>

<li><p>Project management</p></li>

<li><p>Computational text analysis / support</p></li>

<li><p>Interface design and / or usability</p></li>

<li><p>Visualisation</p></li>

<li><p>Database development</p></li>

<li><p>Technical upkeep</p></li>

<li><p>Encoding content</p></li>

<li><p>Developing digital scholarship software</p></li>
</ol>

<p>According to the survey results, support for 84% of digital
scholarship activities are provided by the library, the rest elsewhere
in or outside the institution; it therefore creates demand for a
coordinated effort of current and new library services in a physical
and virtual manner</p>

<h2>1. The University of Pretoria (UP) Library Makerspace</h2>

<h3>1.1 Rationale</h3>

<p>Dr Heila Pienaar, Deputy Director: Strategic Innovation, UP Library
Services, extensively investigated the new trend of Makerspaces from
2014 onwards. A Makerspace can be described as a multidisciplinary
collaboration and creative hack space, where students and staff,
irrespective of discipline, can engage and share resources to explore
and experiment through an inquiry-based learning approach. This space
provides a unique contribution and enables creativity through
resources such as 3D printers, 3D scanners and other electronic
equipment to generate novel and exciting new approaches to problems
within the makers field of interest or expertise. The idea of a
Makerspace originated in the United States, where it was introduced
into libraries to further their educational goals. At the end of 2014
and the beginning of 2015, the UP Library made an investment in
purchasing the necessary equipment, preparing a suitable space and
appointing a student assistant to oversee the daily operations of the
Makerspace. The Makerspace was first introduced to students and
parents during the 2015 Welcoming Day on the 17th of January 2015 (<a
href="pienaar-et-all.html#annualreport2015">Department of Library Services Annual Reports
and Reviews, 2015</a>; <a href="pienaar-et-all.html#olivier2015">Olivier, 2015</a>)</p>

<p>The Makerspace since has been  showcased as a key supportive mechanism
across  departments within  the University  of Pretoria,  to not  only
showcase technological trends which support teaching and learning, but
also drive research outputs with access to key services.</p>

<h3>1.2 Services delivered by the UP Makerspace</h3>

<p>To foster collaboration and support academics, current services of the
UP Library Makerspace include an array of technologies and tools to
support the maker culture, research as well as hybrid teaching and
learning. These services include:</p>

<h4>3D Modelling, scanning and printing</h4>

<h4>3D Modelling</h4>

<p>3D Scanning and modelling has various applications in research,
teaching and learning. Figure 1 is an example of how 3D scanning was
used to scan a bust of a well-known South</p>

<p>African opera singer (Mimi Coertze) in high-resolution for digital
preservation. This 3D model can now be used for replication,
modification, studying or long-term preservation. 3D Scanning also
allows users to experience and grasp the process of creating 3D models
to apply within their specific disciplines. The Makerspace not only
facilitates the physical aspect of 3D scanning but provides access to
software to further enhance, modify or design new and existing models.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../images/issue78-pienaar-et-all/figure1a.png" style="width: 320px;  border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;"><img src="../../images/issue78-pienaar-et-all/figure1b.png" style="width: 320px;  border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;">
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1: 3D Scan of Museum Piece for digital collections and preservation</p>

<h4>3D Printing</h4>

<p>3D printing has allowed for increased capacity to make and
create. Figure 2 demonstrates an example of how 3D printing has
assisted in the advancement of malaria research and sustainable
control thereof. This was achieved by investigating customized tools
and techniques to create ancillary tools to test and distribute
samples for malaria testing. One of which was diffusers for mosquito
feeding. This was in collaboration with the Malaria Parasite Molecular
Laboratory, a Division of Biochemistry, Department of Biochemistry,
Genetics and Microbiology.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../images/issue78-pienaar-et-all/figure2.png" style="width: 640px;  border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 2: 3D Printed mosquito feeders</p>

<h4>‘Mini-me’ 3D scanning and printing</h4>

<p>In order to showcase to students and academics in a fun and
interactive way the process of digitalisation, modelling and 3D
printing, “Mini-me’s” as a service is offered. An example is shown in
Figure 3 below.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="../../images/issue78-pienaar-et-all/figure3a.png" style="width: 320px;  border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;"><img src="../../images/issue78-pienaar-et-all/figure3b.png" style="width: 320px;  border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 3: Mini-me scans and printing</p>

<h4>Provision and Training in electronics</h4>

<p>At the basis of training in electronics is Arduino. This is used as it
offers a vast community platform and support basis, as well as various
application areas. Whilst training is conducted, coding fundamentals
are covered and then applied to the kits to demonstrate the concept of
and inter-relations of the Internet of Things (IoT). This allows
students or academics, irrespective of discipline to begin applying
technology across fields of expertise and achieve new research
outputs. One example of coding practices is shown in Figure 4 below,
to link coding to physical outputs.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../images/issue78-pienaar-et-all/figure4.png" style="width: 640px;  border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 4: Coding practical and 3D design teachings</p>

<p>To relate this code to actual robotics, a robotics training and
collaboration also occurs within the Makerspace. Figure 5 demonstrates
students building a robotics kit where Figure 6 shows the completed
running unit.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../images/issue78-pienaar-et-all/figure5.png" style="width: 640px;  border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;"></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 6: The robot in action</p>

<h4>Integration into aspects of the curriculum for hybrid learning support.</h4>

<p>The collaborative nature of the Makerspace and access to tools and
technologies has seen it being adopted by lectures as part of their
teaching and learning for students. Since its inception, the
Makerspace has played an integral part of the curriculum for the
following subjects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Manufacturing Systems Module (3rd Year)</p></li>

<li><p>Informatics 1st Years module</p></li>

<li><p>Electromechanical Engineering (3rd Year)</p></li>

<li><p>Information Science (3rd Year)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Figure 7 is an example of 3rd year students that had to make use of
additive manufacturing for their assignments. The Makerspace
facilitated the 3D printing as well as guidance on designs, the
department makes use of the space annually for this specific module.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../images/issue78-pienaar-et-all/figure7a.png" style="width: 320px;  border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;"><img src="../../images/issue78-pienaar-et-all/figure7b.png" style="width: 320px;  border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 7: 3rd Year Engineering Students making use of the Makerspace</p>

<p>To further enhance the teaching and learning experience of our
students the Makerspace strategically integrated into the UP Business
incubator (rapid prototyping of products and entrepreneurial
support). This allows our students to skill themselves up beyond the
stage of just prototyping into a space where they can develop actual
products that can go to market.</p>

<h4>Hosting Hackathons with industry partners</h4>

<p>This is also a method in which we expose students to industry
challenges by giving them a glimpse into the work environment. Some of
the Hackathons hosted by the Makerspace are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Intel Hackathon</p></li>

<li><p>#GirlCode Hackathon</p></li>

<li><p>Microsoft AI Hackathon</p></li>

<li><p>The South African Resilience Lab</p></li>

<li><p>Standard Bank Challenge Hackathon</p></li>

<li><p>LaunchLab Challenges</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Physical Collaboration space</h4>

<p>In addition to some of the aforementioned services the physical space
is one that fosters collaboration and creativity. The Makerspace is
flexible to the extent that the venue can change to accommodate a
variety of activities ranging from hosting workshops and lectures to a
playground for robotics. Figure 8 is an example of a Senior Lecturer
hosting a lecture on innovation in the Makerspace to make the concepts
relevant. The Makerspace activities are not bound by its physical
location, some of the training and consultation that the Makerspace
facilitated at various external locations are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Software and Data Carpentry Training</p></li>

<li><p>Design Thinking Workshops</p></li>

<li><p>Veterinary Science Skills Lab</p></li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../images/issue78-pienaar-et-all/figure8.png" style="width: 640px;  border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 8: Collaboration Session with Entrepreneurship students</p>

<h3>1.3 Applications/ Practical Examples</h3>

<p>In the early months running up to the official opening of the UP
Library Makerspace, the increase in 3D printing requests and income
from 3D materials showed that students were actively using the
facility. This has continued to steadily increase year on year as
awareness and applications within curriculum expands. A number of
collaborative projects have been done with campus partners and
departments such as the Department of Mechanical and Aeronautical
Engineering, Department of Industrial Engineering, Department of
Electro Mechanical Engineering, Department of Informatics, Department
of Computer Science, Department of Communication Pathology, Department
of Neuro-Physiotherapy, Department of Anatomy, Veterinary Sciences
Skills Lab, Virtual Mining Lab (Kumba Virtual Mining Lab), and the
South African Resilience Lab (SARILab). The Maker Movement and
Makerspaces have a very strong focus on Do It Yourself (DIY), and by
guiding users on the application and integration of technologies into
their field, irrespective of discipline, has enabled them in like
never before. Part of the movement is collaboration, which further
broadens horizons where expertise is not immediately available within
the space. As such, the</p>

<p>Makerspace is not limited in terms of expertise, but rather, a
physical point for researchers to test and explore concepts through a
hands-on approach. This is also a perfect starting point for young
entrepreneurs, who can ideate, test, and if they fail, fail quickly to
revise until a viable concept is found. As such, the Library, in
collaboration with the Department of Business Management, also formed
a strategic working relationship that sees the Makerspace becoming the
primary rapid prototyping platform during the business incubation
process. This interdepartmental collaboration has provided students an
easy point of entry for assistance with their entrepreneurial ideas
and ventures. Thus, this space also provides a bidirectional link to a
whole range of services provided by the Library, the University of
Pretoria Business Incubator and the Library Makerspace (<a
href="pienaar-et-all.html#annualreport2016">Department of Library Services Annual Reports
and Reviews, 2016</a>).</p>

<p>A direct outcome has been research projects across faculties (Economic
and Management Sciences, Engineering, Built Environment and
Information Technology, Health Sciences, Humanities and Natural and
Agricultural Sciences).</p>

<p>In Figure 9 below, a research project with the Department of Human
Nutrition, in the Faculty of Health Sciences is one such example. The
aim of the project was to measure human perceptions of food portions
in different environments and plate designs. This required consistent
food portions. As such food models were scanned and modelled to
specification and then pointed to test and obtain the required data
for the research project.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../images/issue78-pienaar-et-all/figure9.png" style="width: 640px;  border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 9: 3D Designed and printed food designs for research in portion size perceptions</p>

<p>Another example is a smart glove being used in the Veterinary Sciences
field. The researcher is investigating pressure sensitive situations
while testing bovines. In order to do so a smart glove was required to
obtain this data using force touch sensors. An example of the glove is
shown in Figure 10 below.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../images/issue78-pienaar-et-all/figure10.png" style="width: 640px;  border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 10: Smart Glove for research in veterinary sciences</p>

<p>From a teaching and learning support perspective, the Makerspace
worked closely with an ingenious lecturer Dr. Punchoo to develop best
methods and practices by using 3D technologies in new ways. This
collaboration allowed the Makerspace to work across disciplines and
aid a visually impaired student. The images used were derived from
prescribed readings in the field of Human Physiology, and, through
several tested techniques, adapted for easier use and eligibility in
physical form. Methods in the 3-D print design employed tracing, CAD
software, mechanical reproduction with the printers and finally
braille-labelling. A legend was created in order to follow the tagged
graphs to allow audio-feedback. The student, tutor and lecturer were
interviewed for feedback and confirmed revision areas required for 3-D
print amendments. By making the human physiology imagery legible in
physical form, key concepts which aligned to studying strategies could
be deployed, to allow teaching and assessment. This can now be applied
to other fields for enhanced learning. An example is shown in Figure
11 below.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../images/issue78-pienaar-et-all/figure11.png" style="width: 640px;  border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 11: Printing a 3D diagram for a visually impaired student. Poster about this project won first prize at the SAAHE 2018 conference</p>

<h3>1.4 Challenges</h3>

<p>With the drive towards innovation, especially in a tertiary
institution environment, challenges do arise.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The planning and coordination of setting up the 1st Academic Makerspace in South Africa meant that we did not have a local blueprint to follow, so there was a risk in whether the model would work locally</p></li>

<li><p>Internally there was resistance by staff on the repurposing of space used for studying</p></li>

<li><p>Organisational awareness challenge in that the majority of staff and students did not know the purpose of a Makerspace.</p></li>

<li><p>Makerspaces in general have issues around sustainability so there was a challenge on how we would fund and maintain the Makerspace once it was implemented</p></li>

<li><p>Finding qualified staff to manage and coordinate the space</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Why a Digital Scholarship Centre (DSC) in the Library?</h2>

<h3>2.1 Rationale</h3>

<p>As mentioned in the introduction, academic libraries were quick to
position themselves as incubators for this transformation of research,
by developing shared virtual and physical places for fostering digital
scholarly inquiry (<a href="pienaar-et-all.html#nmc-horizon-report2017">NMC Horizon report, 2017</a>). According to the Joint
Information Systems Committee (Jisc) &amp; the Coalition for Networked
Coalition (CNI) report on international advances in digital
scholarship “The digital scholarship centres (DSC) that have become
fashionable are often located in the library providing a focus for
this type of activity (broad set of digital services to support
research)” (<a href="pienaar-et-all.html#lynch-et-al2016">Lynch et al, 2016</a>).</p>

<p>In his article “The University Library as Incubator for Digital
Scholarship” (<a href="pienaar-et-all.html#sinclair2014">Sinclair, 2014</a>)
Brian Sinclair, associate dean, Public Services, at Georgia State
University Library, describes the natural extension of existing
library services into supporting Digital Scholarship and appropriately
states that “In all of these ways, libraries can be seen as digital
scholarship Makerspaces”.</p>

<h3>2.2 Examples of international Digital Scholarship Centres</h3>

<p>Several international examples of Centres for Digital Scholarship in Academic Libraries exist, e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li>Centre for Digital Scholarship, University of Leiden Library, the
Netherlands (<a href="pienaar-et-all.html#leiden">Universiteit Leiden Centre for Digital Scholarship web
site</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Leiden Centre for Digital Scholarship organises meetings
and workshops and it is available for researchers to contact for
questions, consultancy, and training on the following topics: Data
management, Text &amp; data mining, Open access, Publication advice,
Copyright, Collaborative environments and GIS. The Centre also
offers services and advice for digital research projects.</p>

<ul>
<li>Centre for Digital Scholarship, Bodleian Libraries, Oxford, UK.
(<a href="pienaar-et-all.html#bodleian">University of Oxford Bodleian Libraries Centre for Digital
Scholarship web site</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Centre works through diverse partnerships across the Bodleian
Libraries, the wider University collections, the sciences, medical
sciences, social sciences, humanities, and with the community to
subvert and transform scholarship and provide international leadership
in the field, by</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Defining and disseminating emergent digital scholarship</p></li>

<li><p>Inspiring digital curiosity, and</p></li>

<li><p>Opening imaginations</p></li>

<li><p>Centre for Digital Scholarship, University of Queensland Library, Australia (<a href="pienaar-et-all.html#queensland">University of Queensland Centre for Digital Scholarship web site</a>)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The Centre for Digital Scholarship (CDS) is a purpose built teaching,
research and presentation space in the Library that is ideal for
analysing, visualising and interacting with most types of digital
content in a highly collaborative environment. The Centre for Digital
Scholarship also recognises the changing needs of learning and
assessment. Increasingly, students are required to produce digital
outputs such as digital objects or web content and online
exhibitions. In the Centre for Digital Scholarship, students will be
able to access multi-functional spaces, technology and support.</p>

<ul>
<li>Digital Scholarship Center, Temple University, USA (<a href="pienaar-et-all.html#temple">Temple University Digital Scholarship Center web site</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Digital Scholarship Center is a space for collaborative research
in digital humanities, digital arts, cultural analytics, and critical
making, ranging from web-scraping to textual analysis, from 3D
modelling and printing to engineering with Arduinos.</p>

<p>The centre offers a wide-range of technical equipment, software, and
support for scholarly practices involving digital methods for
interdisciplinary research and pedagogy, including text mining and
analysis, working in and creating 3D spaces, using geospatial
technology, incorporating games into education, and much more.</p>

<p>The Digital Scholarship Center Makerspace offers space, equipment, and
support for collaborative and critical making for academic and
personal projects.</p>

<ul>
<li>Center for Digital Scholarship, Brown University Library, USA (<a href="pienaar-et-all.html#brown">Brown University Library Center for Digital Scholarship web site</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Center for Digital Scholarship, a cross-departmental group in the
Brown University Library, supports digital scholarship for the Brown
community and beyond by supporting scholarly and academic activities
that are conducted or enhanced through the use of digital technology,
or that engage with its effects. Services include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Data curation</p></li>

<li><p>Visualisation</p></li>

<li><p>Spatial analysis</p></li>

<li><p>Metadata creation, and</p></li>

<li><p>Digital Humanities</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And DiRT (digital research tools) Directory, which is a registry of
digital research tools for scholarly use. DiRT makes it easy for those
conducting digital research to find resources ranging from content
management systems to music OCR, statistical analysis packages to mind
mapping software (<a href="pienaar-et-all.html#dirt">DiRT Digital Research Tools web site</a>).</p>

<h2>2.3 Services</h2>

<p>A study of the current services of Digital Scholarship Centres shows
that there are a wide variety of services. It can include the
following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Research data management, including Data and Library Carpentry workshops</p></li>

<li><p>Text &amp; data mining</p></li>

<li><p>Open Access</p></li>

<li><p>Publication advice</p></li>

<li><p>Digital Copyright</p></li>

<li><p>Collaborative environments e.g. Virtual Research Environments</p></li>

<li><p>GIS</p></li>

<li><p>3D software &amp; hardware</p></li>

<li><p>Digital Humanities</p></li>

<li><p>Services and advice for digital academic projects:</p></li>

<li><p>Creating and managing digital collections</p></li>

<li><p>Meta-data services</p></li>

<li><p>Management of projects using digital research methods</p></li>

<li><p>Long-term preservation</p></li>

<li><p>Digitisation of analogue primary sources</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Current Digital Scholarship services that the Library provides</h2>

<p>The Library has delivered the following ‘Digital Scholarship’ services
for several years, even prior to the establishment of a Makerspace:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Research Data Management services</p></li>

<li><p>Digitisation services</p></li>

<li><p>Open access services via the Institutional Repository.</p></li>

<li><p>Metadata Creation</p></li>

<li><p>Creating Digital Collections</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Expanding the Library Makerspace concept to create an UP Library Digital Scholarship Centre</h2>

<p>As Digital Scholarship Centres develop over time, they tend to include
tools and technologies similar to those found in Makerspaces, further
supported by other services also offered within the Library. At UP we
started with a successful Makerspace that can be leveraged to
naturally extend and evolve into a fully-fledged Digital Scholarship
Centre.</p>

<p>Currently the UP Library Makerspace addresses some of the needs for
Digital Scholarship, but with the addition of new services, facilities
and infrastructure can be turned into fully operational Digital
Scholarship Centre. The affordances of and existing Makerspace allows
for the following overlapping Digital Scholarship services:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>3D scanning, printing and design projects</p></li>

<li><p>Training in coding, electronics and robotics</p></li>

<li><p>Library and Data carpentry training e.g. OpenRefine, Python, R Studio and Terminal</p></li>

<li><p>Making space available for digital projects</p></li>

<li><p>Services and advice for digital projects</p></li>

<li><p>Virtual space for digital tools and virtual training</p></li>

<li><p>Research data management portfolio</p></li>

<li><p>Digitisation service e.g. digitisation on demand</p></li>

<li><p>Digital exhibits</p></li>

<li><p>Repository for digital objects</p></li>

<li><p>Virtual Research Environments (VRE’s) e.g. Open Science Framework (OSF)</p></li>

<li><p>Computational and Text Analysis</p></li>

<li><p>Data Visualisation</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>

<p>The UP Library is privileged to have initiated a successful Makerspace
that can form the basis for the development of digital scholarship
services. Activities and services that can be defined and classified
as Digital Scholarship Activities are already being facilitated by the
Library Makerspace, this makes the Makerspace the ideal unit from
which to leverage and start a Digital Scholarship Centre. Combining
the features and services of a Makerspace with existing library
services can quickly expedite establishing a fully functional centre.</p>

<p>Developing a Digital Scholarship Centre has also been identified as
one of five strategic focus areas to transform the UP Library into a
modern, dynamic academic library.</p>
