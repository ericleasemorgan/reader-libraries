Conference topics include metadata, peer-review, trustworthiness, best practice, and visualisation of data. DataCite, a federation currently of 12 major library or data members from nine countries, was founded in December 2009 to facilitate access to research data sets over the Internet as citable objects, using the DOI System.</p><p>The scope of this meeting is to allow data centres from all over the world to exchange experience and workflows concerning the handling of research data. The following subjects will be covered by international experts:</p><ul><li>Metadata for datasets – More than pure citation information?</li><li>Peer-review systems and the publication of data sets – Ensuring Quality</li><li>Best practice and examples – What can be done and is done worldwide?</li><li>Trustworthiness of data centers – A technological, a structural and a legal discussion</li><li>Visualisation of datasets – More than meets the eye</li><li>Datasets and scholarly journals – A perfect combination?</li></ul><p>Programme: <a href="http://www.tib-hannover.de/fileadmin/datacite-summer-programme.html">http://www.tib-hannover.de/fileadmin/datacite-summer-programme.html</a></p><p align="right"><br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events4"></a></p><h3>The LIS Research Coalition Conference 2010</h3><p>British Library Conference Centre, London<br>Monday 28 June 2010: 10:30-16:15<br><a href="http://lisresearch.org/conference-2010/">http://lisresearch.org/conference-2010/</a></p><p>The broad conference programme considers perspectives of the LIS research landscape. It will tackle issues relating to identifying LIS research opportunities; translating research outcomes into practice; growing research capacity amongst LIS professionals; and developing the future UK LIS research agenda.</p><p>The programme will appeal to all LIS research stakeholders from funders of LIS-related research activity through to those who publish LIS research output, as well as practitioner researchers and academics. With first-hand access to expert speakers and peers on the day, delegates will develop their knowledge of the LIS research landscape, including the work of the <a href="http://lisresearch.org">LIS Research Coalition</a>, while also increasing their awareness of:</p><ul><li>The diversity of LIS research opportunities</li><li>Research funding sources</li><li>Potential research collaborators</li><li>Means of increasing the relevance of their research efforts</li><li>Avenues for publication of their research output</li><li>Research development opportunities for individuals and groups</li><li>Techniques for integrating research activities into everyday work practice</li></ul><p>The opening keynote speaker, <a href="http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/%7Eadillon/">Professor Andrew Dillon</a> of the University of Texas - an LIS researcher of international repute - will speak on international perspectives of UK LIS research. The closing keynote speaker, Loughborough University's <a href="http://www.lut.ac.uk/departments/ls/people/coppenheim.html">Professor Charles Oppenheim</a> - also an LIS researcher of international standing (and well-known to readers of Ariadne reviews) - will discuss how an examination of the evidence, value and impact of current LIS research can inform the future LIS research agenda.</p><p>Afternoon break-out sessions will be led by a number of experts with research experience in public, academic, special and corporate libraries; the health service; business; publishing; consulting; training; charities and Higher Education.</p><p><strong>Further information:</strong><br>The conference venue is the British Library's state of the art Conference Centre<br><a href="http://www.bl.uk/conferencecentre/conference.html">http://www.bl.uk/conferencecentre/conference.html</a></p><p>Located in central London, the British Library Conference Centre is within easy walking distance of three mainline railway stations - St Pancras (Eurostar terminal), Euston and King's Cross - and six Underground rail lines, and is thus at the heart of the UK and European transportation network.</p><p>The conference fee is £100 inclusive of VAT (£85.10 + £14.90 VAT).</p><p align="right"><br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events5"></a></p><h3>Tipping the scales: tackling information obesity to ensure productive and sustainable information resources</h3><p>A joint UKeiG/BDA Knowledge Management meeting<br>British Dental Association, 64 Wimpole Street , London W1G 8YS<br>Tuesday 29 June 2010, 9.30 - 16.30<br><a href="http://www.ukeig.org.uk/trainingevent/tipping-scales-tackling-information-obesity-ensure-productive-and-sustainable-informat">http://www.ukeig.org.uk/trainingevent/tipping-scales-tackling-information-obesity-ensure-productive-and-sustainable-informat</a></p><h4>Course Outline</h4><p>"Information obesity" describes a condition whereby available information resources are not being used in a productive and sustainable way by individuals or communities. Like physical obesity, it is not just the result of consuming too much, but is linked to declines in the information's quality, and individuals' and communities' awareness of problems which arise through over-consumption. Fitness and (mental) exercise also come into play. The consequences of information obesity may be severe if left unchecked; it will lead to a decline in our ability to manage knowledge, both in our communities and our workplaces.</p><p>As a teaching strategy, information literacy (IL) can partly help to combat the condition. However, as traditionally defined, IL does not address the ways in which the structure of organisations and our own innate cognitive biases prevent us acting as independent and self-aware evaluators of the information we find. This course will help participants understand these biases and how, through work at the community level, they may be overcome, in order that we start using information to sustain ourselves and our communities, and not just consume it unthinkingly.</p><p>This one-day course will include time for plenty of discussion and practical activity. Participants will be encouraged to share their experiences with others and also to build a network of practice after the event.

The guidelines have been developed to help staff working in library and information services tackle complex confidentiality and privacy issues. Such issues include data sharing, the Internet, children, CCTV and what rights police and other security agencies have to demand access to the personal information of users.</p><p>The guidelines were developed following concern that the number of interventions by police and security services seeking confidential information about library users was increasing. CILIP ran a surveillance survey, which indicated this was not the case, but it did reveal a number of places lacking a policy covering this area and a need for advice and guidance.</p><p>Margaret Watson, who led the work on privacy and is chair of CILIP's Ethics Panel, commented on the guidelines, 'Most institutions will have policies relating to the confidentiality of personal information but that doesn't absolve the practitioner from individual responsibility. Under CILIP's Ethical Principles each practitioner has to show "Respect for confidentiality and privacy in dealing with information users". The guidelines will help them in this and, where there are worries about existing practice members must raise the issue in an appropriate manner'.</p><p>[Source: CILIP]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: March 2010</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news4"></a></p><h3>A Roma Journey: Europeana Supports New Web Exhibition from The European Library</h3><p>Europeana invites the public to uncover the Roma's rich cultural heritage through a ground breaking multilingual online exhibition <a href="http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/exhibition/roma_journey/eng/index.html">http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/exhibition/roma_journey/eng/index.html</a></p><p>The display is organised by The European Library which is channelling digitised content from Europe's national and research libraries into Europeana.

OCLC then processed more than 8.8 million records for BnF and over 7.9 million records for ABES. The Bibliothèque municipale de Lyon, the second largest public library in France, contributed more than 1.3 million records to WorldCat.</p><p>With these projects complete, there are now more than 16.3 million French-language records in WorldCat. Just as the total number of WorldCat records has grown substantially in recent years to 175 million, the percentage of French-language records has also increased from 6.2 percent in 2007 to 9.6 percent in 2010.</p><p>"By agreeing to join WorldCat through Sudoc, French academic libraries show that national choices are compatible with an international strategy," said Raymond Bérard, Director of ABES. "We gain visibility through WorldCat while working on a national cataloguing platform based on CBS (metadata management system). ABES is confident that working more closely with other libraries inside the OCLC cooperative will benefit the French library community as well as other libraries in Europe and beyond."</p><p>In addition to the more academically focused content of the Sudoc libraries, the BnF and BM Lyon have contributed an extensive quantity of French content to WorldCat of a more diverse, general, cultural and historical nature. As keeper of five centuries of cultural heritage, the Bibliothèque nationale de France collects, catalogues, preserves and enriches this national heritage via legal deposit and acquisitions.</p><p>The Bibliothèque municipale de Lyon offers extensive collections for wide audiences. A dynamic public library, it was founded by the City of Lyon in the 16th century as the library of its renowned Collège de la Trinité and became widely open to the public in 1765, 24 years before the French Revolution, when it was transformed into a repository for all local collections. It therefore encompasses 15 centuries of knowledge starting with the Merovingian times. Its printed heritage is worthy of the city's role as a major centre of printing in the Renaissance.</p><p>"We think that it is a major asset for our public library to be visible in WorldCat," said Patrick Bazin, Library Director at the BM Lyon. "Not just for the more common types of materials, but especially because more than half of our 3 million documents are rare materials, either books or visual and special collections."</p><p><strong>Further information:</strong><br>OCLC <a href="http://www.oclc.org/">http://www.oclc.org/</a><br>WorldCat <a href="http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/">http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/</a></p><p>[Source: OCLC]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: April 2010</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="footer">Publication Date: 30-April-2010 Publication: Ariadne Issue 63<br>Originating URL: http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue63/newsline/</p>
