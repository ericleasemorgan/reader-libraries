The explicit representation of the semantics of data, accompanied with domain theories (Ontologies), will enable a web that provides a qualitatively new level of service. It will weave together an incredibly large network of human knowledge and will complement it with machine processability. Various automated services will help the user to achieve goals by accessing and providing information in machine-understandable form. This process may ultimately create extremely knowledgeable systems with various specialized reasoning services systems. Many technologies and methodologies are being developed within Artificial Intelligence, Human Language Technology, Machine Learning, Databases, Software Engineering and Information Systems that can contribute towards the realization of this vision.</p><p>The 2nd Annual European Semantic Web Conference will present the latest results in research and application in semantic web technologies (including knowledge mark-up languages, semantic web services, ontology management and more). ESWC 2005 will also feature a special industry-oriented event providing European industry with an opportunity to become even more familiar with these technologies. It will offer a tutorial program to get up to speed with European and global developments in this exciting new area.</p><p>ESWC 2005 is co-located with a meeting of the Knowledge Web Network of Excellence. Workshops and meetings of other European Commission 6th Framework Programme projects involved in the semantic web and semantic web technologies will be able to showcase their developments.</p><p>ESWC 2005 is sponsored by SDK - a group of three European Commission 6th Framework Programme projects known as SEKT, DIP and Knowledge Web. Together these projects aim to improve world-wide research and standardisation in the area of the Semantic Web.

In recent years, there have been fragmented attempts to define a set of basic requirements for persistently identifying digital information. In an attempt to build upon the results of previous events and to help coordinate future efforts, the Digital Curation Centre, the National Information Standards Organization (NISO), the Electronic Resource Preservation and Access Network (ERPANET), and the Centre for Educational Technology Interoperability Standards (CETIS) are working together to deliver a series of related events which will aim to establish wider agreement of some common requirements for creating globally unique, persistent identifiers.</p><p>Further information about the programme, course fees and registration can be found at <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/piworkshop.html">http://www.dcc.ac.uk/piworkshop.html</a></p><p align="right"><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events11"></a></p><h3>Digital Curation Centre (DCC) Workshop on Long-term Curation within Digital Repositories</h3><p>6 July 2005<br>Møller Centre, Cambridge, UK</p><p>Digital repositories have become an increasingly recognised means of digitally archiving and enabling access to digital information. The long-term survival, value and usability of the information stored within digital repositories depends on numerous criteria such as the formats selected for storage, the capture of associated metadata, proactive preservation measures, and the perceived trust in the repository itself. This event will focus on practical tools and approaches that are currently being used or developed to assist with the long-term curation of digital information within digital repositories.

The research area of grid computing is making rapid progress, owing to the increasing necessity of computation in the resolution of complex applications.</p><p>Clusters are, in some sense, the predecessors of the grid technology. Clusters interconnect nodes through a local high-speed network, using commodity hardware, with the aim of reducing the costs of such infrastructures. Supercomputers have been replaced by cluster of workstations in a huge number of research projects, being the grid technology the natural evolution of clusters.</p><p>One of the major goals of grid computing is to provide efficient access to data. Grids provide access to distributed computing and data resources, allowing data-intensive applications to improve significantly data access, management and analysis. Nowadays, there is a huge number of data-intensive applications, e.g. data mining systems extracting knowledge from large volumes of data. Existing data-intensive applications have been used in several domains, such as physics, climate modelling, biology or visualization. Grid systems responsible for tackling and managing large amounts of data in geographically distributed environments are usually named data grids.</p><p>The great challenge of grid computing is the complete integration of heterogeneous computing systems and data resources with the aim of providing a global computing space. The achievement of this goal will involve revolutionary changes in the field of computation, because it will enable resource-sharing across networks, being data one of the most important ones.</p><p>This workshop is intended for researchers in grid computing, who want to extend their background on this area and more specifically to those that use grid environments for managing and analysing data.</p><h3>TOPICS OF INTEREST</h3><p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Computational grids</li><li>Data integration on grids</li><li>Grid-based data mining</li><li>Grid solutions for data-intensive applications</li><li>Grid infrastructures for data analysis</li><li>High-performance computing for data-intensive applications</li><li>Grid computing infrastructures, middleware and tools</li><li>Grid computing services</li><li>Grid and cluster computing</li><li>Collaboration technologies</li><li>Data analysis and management</li><li>Databases and the grid</li><li>Extracting knowledge from data grids</li><li>Agent-based management of data in distributed systems</li><li>Agent architectures for grid environments</li><li>Semantic Grid</li><li>Data grids for bioinformatics</li><li>Security in data grids</li></ul><h3>Submission Requirements</h3><p>All submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of expression.

Connotea enables you to store your reference list online which means that it&rsquo;s readily accessible, it&rsquo;s linked directly into the literature and it&rsquo;s easily shared with colleagues. By opening up their references to others, researchers are able to discover new leads by connecting to the reference collections of those with similar interests. In fact, Connotea allows users to save links to any online content, making it easy to store their entire collection of reference materials in one place.</p><p>Connotea also recognises links to certain Web sites, and automatically collects the bibliographic information for the article or book that is being linked to. See the <a href="http://www.connotea.org/guide">site guide</a> for the list of currently supported sites.</p><p>It is possible to organise a collection of references and Web sites by simply assigning tags (free-form categories or labels) to the links saved and assign as many tags as required to a bookmark. This is different to the conventional approach of organising links into hierarchical folders, and makes a library of bookmarks much easier to navigate.</p><p>Every page of bookmarks on Connotea has a link to an RSS feed. If another user is discovered to be bookmarking interesting things under a certain tag, it is possible to navigate to the relevant page and subscribe to that RSS feed. Connotea also maintains an <a href="http://www.connotea.org/news.rdf">RSS feed</a> for news about Connotea.</p><p>Two articles published in the <a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/april05/04contents.html">April 2005</a> issue of <em>D-Lib Magazine</em> provide a general overview of the social bookmarking tool landscape and then discuss Connotea as a case study.

This release represents a significant increase in features and functionality over previous releases. New features include the ability to represent and query relationships among digital objects, a simple XML encoding for Fedora digital objects, enhanced ingest and export interfaces for interoperability with other repository systems, enhanced administrative features, and improved documentation.</p><p>As with prior versions of the software, all Fedora functionality is exposed through Web service interfaces. At the core of this functionality is the Fedora object model that enables the aggregation of multiple content items into digital objects. This allows objects to have several accessible &ldquo;representations.&rdquo; For example, a digital object can represent an electronic document in multiple formats, a digital image with its descriptive metadata, or a complex science publication containing text, data, and video. Services can be associated with digital objects, allowing dynamically-produced views, or &ldquo;virtual representations&rdquo; of the objects. Historical views of digital objects are preserved through a powerful content versioning system.</p><p>The new Fedora 2.0 introduces the &ldquo;Resource Index&rdquo; which is a module that allows a Fedora repository to be viewed as a graph of inter-related objects. Using the Resource Description Framework (RDF), relationships among objects can be declared, and queries against these relationships are supported by an RDF-based triple store. Fedora 2.0 also introduces &ldquo;Fedora Object XML&rdquo; (FOXML) which is a simple XML format for encoding Fedora digital objects.</p><p>The Fedora open-source software is jointly developed by Cornell University and the University of Virginia with generous funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Fedora 2.0 marks the final milestone in Phase I, a three year project to develop the core Fedora Repository system.</p><p>For more information, contact Ronda Grizzle <a href="mailto:rag9b@virginia.edu">rag9b@virginia.edu</a> Technical Coordinator; Sandra Payette (<a href="mailto:payette@cs.cornell.edu">payette@cs.cornell.edu</a>), Co-director Cornell University; or Thornton Staples (<a href="mailto:tls@virginia.edu">tls@virginia.edu</a>), Co-director University of Virginia.</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: March 2005</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news8"></a></p><h3>ICT Training Highlights Changing Role of Library Workforce</h3><p>All 40,000 public library staff across the UK have received ICT training and are using new skills to improve services for library users. A major new study undertaken by the Tavistock Institute and published today assesses the impact of this £20 million training programme, which has been funded as part of the People&rsquo;s Network, the national project to link all 4200 public libraries to the Internet.</p><p>The study highlights a paradigm shift for public libraries, spurred by the introduction of new technologies. It shows how the People&rsquo;s Network has helped open up a range of possible future scenarios for libraries and begun to shape new professional identities for library staff.</p><p>The changes identified in the report will have a profound impact on the nature of the library workforce, which will need a range of capabilities, dispositions and skills to be effective in the future. ICT training is seen as just one step towards the organisational changes required. But already it is having an impact, both on staff and library users. Welcoming the report, MLA Chief Executive Chris Batt, said, &ldquo;The People&rsquo;s Network has been a catalyst for change in the way public libraries serve their communities, and the staff are at the heart of that transformation.</p><p>&ldquo;This training is part of a major transformation programme for public libraries. As the vision and values of library services evolve, a degree of cultural change is necessary too. Libraries will have to re-assess how they view themselves and organisational capability must go hand in hand with professional development if we are to meet the needs of both current and future library users.&rdquo;</p><p>The report forms a companion piece to the evaluation of the People&rsquo;s Network, undertaken by the Tavistock Institute for the Big Lottery Fund published in November 2004.

Athens, developed by Eduserv, is the British standard to access Web-based subscription services for higher education, further education, and research councils. The system enables these institutions to manage access rights efficiently to multiple online resources.</p><p>As a result of this cooperation with Athens, users affiliated with U.K. institutions that subscribe to both Project MUSE and Athens can now access the full text of the 270 scholarly journals that MUSE hosts from a variety of locations, including at home, on campus, while travelling, or from any place that has an Internet connection. All users need is an Athens password/username which allows them to gain access to any Athens-compliant resource (including MUSE) to which their home institution subscribes.</p><p>Through partnerships with several organizations offering gateway bibliographic services, MUSE is linked to the databases of many vendors such as ABC-CLIO, EBSCO, and ProQuest. MUSE offers subscribing libraries a &ldquo;For Librarians&rdquo; Web page to help educate their users about the resource and manage their subscriptions. This web page enables librarians to download details about MUSE holdings, request promotional materials, and find answers to common questions. Several new instructional guides are available for downloading, from general tips to subject-specific guides in fifteen major disciplines.</p><p>For more information on MUSE: <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu."> <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu">http://muse.jhu.edu</a>. </a></p><p>For more information about Eduserv Athens: <a href="http://www.athensams.net/"> <a href="http://www.athensams.net/">http://www.athensams.net/</a> </a></p><p align="right">[<em>Received: April 2005</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news11"></a></p><h3>New Appointments at MLA</h3><h3>New Chief Executive Appointed to South West Museums, Libraries and Archives Council</h3><p>SWMLAC is delighted to announce the appointment of <strong>Bob Sharpe</strong> as its new Chief Executive from July 2005.
