        <p><b>Metadata</b>. The word is increasingly to be found bandied about amongst the Web <i>cognoscenti</i>, but what exactly is it, and is it something that can be of value to you and your work? This article aims to explore some of the issues involved in metadata and then, concentrating specifically upon the Dublin Core, move on to show in a non-technical fashion how metadata may be used by anyone to make their material more accessible. A <a href="metadata-masses.html#refs">collection of references</a> at the end of the article provides pointers to some of the current work in this field. <a name="metawhat"></a></p><hr><h3>What is metadata?</h3><p>The concept of metadata predates the Web, having purportedly been coined by Jack Myers in the 1960's (<a href="metadata-masses.html#howe_96">Howe 1996</a>) to describe datasets effectively. Metadata is data <i>about</i> data, and therefore provides basic information such as the author of a work, the date of creation, links to any related works, <i>etc</i>. One recognisable form of metadata is the card index catalogue in a library; the information on that card is metadata <i>about</i> a book. Perhaps without knowing it, you use metadata in your work every day, whether you are noting down the publication details of a book that you want to order, or wandering through <a href="http://www.ordsvy.gov.uk/Sines.html">SINES</a> or the <a href="http://hds.essex.ac.uk/">History Data Unit</a> in the hope of finding a particular data set of value to your research project.</p><p>Metadata exists for almost every conceivable object or group of objects, whether stored in electronic form or not. A paper map from the <a href="http://www.ordsvy.gov.uk">Ordnance Survey of Great Britain</a>, for example, has associated metadata such as its scale, the date of survey and date of publication. With products such as maps, the metadata is often clearly visible on the map itself, and is expressed using standard conventions that are easily interpretable by the experienced user (<a href="metadata-masses.html#miller_95">Miller 1995</a>).</p><center><table><tbody><tr><td width="590"><center><a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue/5/metadata-masses/vale_of_york.gif"><img alt="A simple example of map metadata for the Vale of York" src="../../images/issue5-metadata-masses/meta_york.gif" style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; "></a></center></td></tr><tr><td width="590"><center><a name="figure1"><i>Figure 1</i></a><i>: a simple example of map metadata (after <a href="metadata-masses.html#apmiller_96a">Miller 1996</a></i><a href="metadata-masses.html#apmiller_96a">a</a><i>).

These generalised standards do not yet exist, and it can be surprisingly difficult to actually find the information for which you are searching. The current generation of <a href="http://home.netscape.com/home/internet-search.html">search engines</a> are undoubtedly powerful, and capable of returning a large number of suggestions in response to any search, but it is almost impossible to cut through the irrelevant suggestions to find the ones you are actually interested in. A search for <i>Ariadne</i> on <a href="http://altavista.digital.com/">Alta Vista</a>, for example, found 5,468 references, and returned 3,000 links. On the first page of links, there was a pointer to Issue 3, but nothing else relevant to <i>my</i> needs turned up until the very bottom of the third page. In this case, it was fairly straightforward to distinguish between the (relevant);</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

</li></dir><p>This simple example illustrates some of the problems with finding information on the Web. It is perhaps analogous (or perhaps not!) to a paper-based list of contacts which, rather than being sorted conventionally by surname, is sorted simultaneously by the contents of <i>every</i> field (surname, company, street, <i>etc</i>). Of course, when you attempt to look up an address in this contact list, you have no way of knowing which field the result is coming from. Assuming you wish to contact our esteemed web editor to offer an article for <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/ariadne/"><i>Ariadne</i></a> (<a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/ariadne/about/submit.html">hint</a>!) and search for his surname (Kirriemuir), you don't <i>really</i> know whether the result you have found is really him, or part of the address of some long-forgotten relative from a small Scottish town just west of Forfar.</p><p>To make your contact list useful, you need some metadata to describe what each string of text relates to (<i>ie</i> <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/~lisjwk/">Kirriemuir</a> is a</p>

<p>or <a href="http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/~alan/maps.html">Kirriemuir</a> is a</p>

<p>).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most applications are, of course, more complex than this, but it is at least possible to demonstrate the principles using this simple case study. How, then, are the 'experts' currently approaching the description of metadata? <a name="metaexist"></a></p><hr><h3>Existing approaches to metadata</h3><p>A large number of standards have evolved for describing electronic resources, but the majority are concerned with describing very specific resources, and often rely upon complicated subject-specific schema that make either widespread adoption or easy accessibility to these records unlikely. Rachel Heery (<a href="metadata-masses.html#heery_f">forthcoming</a>) offers a review of some of the major metadata formats in a forthcoming article.</p><p>In an environment such as the traditional library, where cataloguing and acquisition are the sole preserve of trained professionals, complex metadata schemes such as MARC (MAchine Readable Catalogue) are, perhaps, acceptable means of resource description. In the more chaotic online world, however, new resources appear all the time, often created and maintained by interested individuals rather than large centrally funded organisations. As such, it is difficult for anyone to easily locate information and data of value to them and the large search engines - with all their faults - are often the only means by which new information may be found.</p><p>In such an environment, there is an obvious requirement for metadata, but this metadata must be of a form suitable for interpretation both by the search engines and by human beings, and it must also be simple to create so that <i>any</i> web page author may easily describe the contents of their page and make it immediately both more accessible and more useful. As such, compromises must be made in order to provide as much useful information as possible to the searcher while leaving the technique simple enough to be used by the maximum number of people with the minimum degree of inconvenience. <a name="expert"></a></p><h4><a name="expert">The expert approach</a></h4><p>A large number of techniques exist for the description of resources in an electronic medium, ranging from the various flavours of MARC (<a href="metadata-masses.html#bl_80">British Library 1980</a>, <a href="metadata-masses.html#loc_94">Library of Congress 1994</a>, <a href="metadata-masses.html#heery_f">Heery forthcoming</a>) used in library cataloguing to the more specialised Directory Interchange Format (DIF) which provides metadata for satellite imagery and the like (<a href="metadata-masses.html#gcmd_96">GCMD 1996</a>).</p><p>Developments such as the Text Encoding Initiative (<a href="http://www.uic.edu/orgs/tei">TEI</a>) have gone a long way towards allowing a standardised description of electronic texts, and the ongoing review of the US National Spatial Data Infrastructure (<a href="http://fgdc.er.usgs.gov/nsdi2.html">NSDI</a>) will hopefully succeed in realising a similar scheme for the complex issues involved in describing spatial data. In the United Kingdom, the provisionally named National Geospatial Database (<a href="metadata-masses.html#ngd_95">Nanson <i>et al</i> 1995</a>) is aiming to increase the integration between governmental and non-governmental spatial data holdings, and careful thought will need to be given to the construction of rational metadata schemes for this project over the next year or two.</p><p>Each of these formats has been developed to operate within a narrowly defined field of work, and is poorly suited to the description of a wider range of resources. Many of these existing metadata schemes are also extremely complex, and are geared towards creation by experts and interpretation by computers, rather than both creation and interpretation by as wide a range of interested parties as possible.</p><p>In cutting through the morass of existing - and often conflicting - metadata approaches, the work of <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/elib/">eLib</a> projects such as <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/roads/">ROADS</a>, <a href="http://www.adam.ac.uk/">ADAM</a> <i>et al</i> will be well worth watching, as will the efforts of the Arts &amp; Humanities Data Service (<a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/projects/ahds/top.html">AHDS</a>) to create a pan-subject metadata index that encompasses the current AHDS projects for <a href="http://intarch.york.ac.uk/ahds/welcome.html">Archaeology</a>, <a href="http://dawww.essex.ac.uk/hist.html">History</a>, <a href="http://sable.ox.ac.uk/ota/">Text</a> and the <a href="http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk:80/PADS/">Performing Art s</a>, as well as any future projects. It is interesting to note that several of these projects (<a href="http://intarch.york.ac.uk/ahds/welcome.html">ADS</a>, <a href="http://www.adam.ac.uk/">ADAM</a>) have already adopted a form of Dublin Core description for at least some of their pages. As with this document, Dublin Core metadata is often stored in the &lt;<a href="http://www.sandia.gov/sci_compute/elements.html#HEAD">HEAD</a>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.sandia.gov/sci_compute/elements.html#HEAD">/HEAD</a>&gt; area of a Web page, and may be viewed simply by selecting</p>

This approach to the description of 'Document Like Objects' is still under development, and is the focus of a great deal of activity worldwide as researchers work to produce the most useful model they can, capable of describing the majority of resources available on the Internet as a whole, and suitable for inserting into a wide range of file types from the simple HyperText Markup Language (<a href="http://www.sandia.gov/sci_compute/html_ref.html">HTML</a>) of the Web to Postscript files and other image formats (<i>eg</i> <a href="metadata-masses.html#knight_96">Knight 1996</a>, <a href="metadata-masses.html#beckett_96">Beckett 1996</a>). Despite the emphasis of this, and other, papers (<a href="metadata-masses.html#apmiller_96b">A.P. Miller 1996<i>b</i></a>, <a href="metadata-masses.html#emiller_96a">E. Miller 1996<i>a</i></a>, <a href="metadata-masses.html#emiller_96b">E. Miller 1996<i>b</i></a>, <a href="metadata-masses.html#weibel_96">Weibel 1996</a>) on the HTML implementation of Dublin Core, readers should remember that the concepts are equally applicable to virtually any other file format. In the case of this article, the HTML implementation is stressed because it is felt that this is the area in which the underlying concepts may most easily be demonstrated, and because it is in the provision of metadata for the many thousands of personal pages out on the Web that a structure such as Dublin Core may most rapidly make an impact of value to readers of <i>Ariadne</i>. With luck, once you have followed the examples here and filled your text web pages with Dublin Core metadata, you will then feel both sufficiently enthused and competent to further explore the <a href="metadata-masses.html#refs">references</a> in order to add metadata to your more complex file formats.</p><p>As Dempsey argues (<a href="metadata-masses.html#dempsey_96b">1996<i>b</i></a>), Dublin Core metadata descriptions exist between the crude metadata currently employed by search engines and the complex mass of information encoded within records such as those for MARC or the Federal Geographic Data Committee (<a href="metadata-masses.html#fgdc_94">FGDC 1994</a>).</p><p><a name="core"></a></p><h4><a name="core">The Core Element Set</a></h4><p><a name="table1"> The Dublin Core</a> itself consists of thirteen core elements, each of which may be further extended by the use of</p>

<p>In writing metadata such as this, the user may include as many of the elements from <a href="metadata-masses.html#table1">Table 1</a> as necessary, and each of these fields may be repeated several times in order to describe all relevant details. In the example above, elements such as</p>
<pre>Coverage</pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>ObjectType</pre>
<p>have not been used at all, while those such as</p>
<pre>Author</pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>Publisher</pre>
<p>have been used several times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As Beckett (<a href="metadata-masses.html#beckett_96">1996</a>) notes, the use of case (</p>
<pre>ABC...</pre>
<p>as opposed to</p>
<pre>abc...</pre>
<p>) and whitespace (</p>
<pre>A B C...</pre>
<p>as opposed to</p>
<pre>ABC...</pre>
<p>) is not strictly defined within the Dublin Core, and may be modified to suit individual user and project requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While not formally part of the Dublin Core definition, a recognised 'good practice' is evolving, whereby the Dublin Core element name is given in lower case, preceded by an identifier in upper case to denote that the element is from Dublin Core (</p>
<pre>DC.author</pre>
<p>, rather than</p>
<pre>DC.AUTHOR</pre>
<p>,</p>
<pre>dc.AUTHOR</pre>

<pre>SCHEME</pre>
<p>should be given in upper case, while the values of each should normally be given in lower case (or a mixture of the two, where proper names <i>etc</i> are involved).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the most basic, a Dublin Core entry coded within HTML should therefore take the form;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>&lt;META NAME="DC.<i>element name</i>" CONTENT="<i>value of element</i>"&gt;</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>eg</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a name="link"></a></p><h4><a name="link">Use of the &lt;LINK&gt; tag</a></h4><p>Although undoubtedly easier for the casual viewer to understand than many metadata schemes, the Dublin Core still presents scope for ambiguity in understanding, both of the core elements themselves and in the many</p>
<pre><a href="metadata-masses.html#scheme">SCHEME</a></pre>
<p>s involved in adding extra information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The solution adopted for overcoming these ambiguities is to include a reference to further information through the HTML &lt;<a href="http://www.sandia.gov/sci_compute/elements.html#LINK">LINK</a>&gt; tag (<a href="metadata-masses.html#weibel_96">Weibel 1996</a>, <a href="metadata-masses.html#apmiller_96b">A.P.Miller 1996<i>b</i></a>). For each occurence of a Dublin Core element, a &lt;<a href="http://www.sandia.gov/sci_compute/elements.html#LINK">LINK</a>&gt; is provided to the definition of that element on the Dublin Core page at <a href="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements">http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements</a>, and for each use of a</p>
<pre><a href="metadata-masses.html#scheme">SCHEME</a></pre>
<p>a link is provided to an on- or off-line definition of the syntax used within that scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>e.g.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The</p>
<pre>SCHEME</pre>
<p>qualifier identifies any widely recognised coding system used in the description of a specific Dublin Core element, and allows a degree of consistency and standardisation to be introduced to Dublin Core records. Instead of describing (in the</p>
<pre>Form</pre>
<p>element) a web page as being "a web page", "HTML" or "HyperText Markup Language", for example, it is far easier and more consistent to use the existing Internet Media Types (IMT) and describe it as "text/html". In Dublin Core's HTML syntax, this would be represented as;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>&lt;META NAME="DC.form" CONTENT="(SCHEME=<b>imt</b>) <b>text/html</b>"&gt;</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>and should also be provided with the necessary &lt;<a href="http://www.sandia.gov/sci_compute/elements.html#LINK">LINK</a>&gt;s, as discussed <a href="metadata-masses.html#link">above</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>A</p>
<pre>SCHEME</pre>
<p>should <i>only</i> refer to the name of an existing coding system such as the Internet Media Type (IMT), or the International Standards Organisation standard on dates (ISO31), and should <i>not</i> be used for identifying, for example, that a use of the</p>
<pre>Author</pre>
<p>element is referring to a name, e-mail address, or whatever. For tasks such as this, the</p>
<pre>TYPE</pre>
<p>qualifier should be used. This suggestion differs from that given in the most comprehensive list of</p>
<pre>SCHEME</pre>
<p>s and</p>
<pre>TYPE</pre>
<p>s currently available (<a href="metadata-masses.html#kni_ham_96">Knight &amp; Hamilton 1996</a>), but appears to create a more logical use of the two qualifiers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Knight &amp; Hamilton (<a href="metadata-masses.html#kni_ham_96">1996</a>) suggest including the vast majority of qualifiers to a metadata entry within</p>
<pre>SCHEME</pre>
<p>and only use</p>
<pre>TYPE</pre>
<p>in a few cases. This author would suggest a different division, whereby only references to coding schemes appear in</p>
<pre>SCHEME</pre>
<p>and most other qualifiers appear in</p>
<pre>TYPE</pre>
<p>. As a simple rule of thumb, <b>if a &lt;<a href="http://www.sandia.gov/sci_compute/elements.html#LINK">LINK</a>&gt; can be included to an on- or off-line definition, then it is a </b></p>
<pre><b>SCHEME</b></pre>
<p><b>and if not, it is a </b></p>
<pre><b>TYPE</b></pre>
<p>. An early implementation of this model was produced by the author (<a href="metadata-masses.html#apmiller_96b">1996<i>b</i></a>), and the beginnings of a second may be seen evolving at <a href="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/~napm1/ads/DC_scheme_type.html">http://www.ncl.ac.uk/~napm1/ads/DC_ scheme_type.html</a>, where a comprehensive list of</p>
<pre>SCHEME</pre>
<p>s and</p>
<pre>TYPE</pre>
<p>s will soon be available, along with guidance on usage for each.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The</p>
<pre>TYPE</pre>
<p>qualifier, then, is mainly used where a Dublin Core element occurs more than once in a metadata description. You may, for example, use the</p>
<pre>Author</pre>
<p>element several times in order to provide name, address and telephone information. In a case such as this, the</p>
<pre>TYPE</pre>
<p>qualifier would be used to differentiate between each occurrence of</p>
<pre>Author</pre>

If the core element set were extended in order to attempt this, it would rapidly become large and unwieldy, and ultimately one of the incomprehensibly complex metadata schemes that Dublin Core was created to avoid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The currently held view of Dublin Core is that it should <i>not</i> be directly extended itself, but that any necessary extensions should be included in a separate 'package', as proposed in the Warwick Framework (<a href="metadata-masses.html#lagoze_96">Lagoze <i>et al</i> 1996</a>). Descriptions stored within this new 'package' may then either be from a totally different metadata scheme, such as <a href="metadata-masses.html#gcmd_96">DIF</a> or <a href="metadata-masses.html#fgdc_94">FGDC</a>, or they may be simple extensions to the thirteen Dublin Core elements, and described in a Dublin Core-like syntax.</p><p>In the same way as the package of metadata known as the Dublin Core is enclosed within</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

...

&lt;META NAME="package" CONTENT="(TYPE=end) Dublin Core"&gt;

<p>(<i>eg</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p><a name="future"></a></p><hr><h3>What the future holds...</h3><p>Given rapid changes both in metadata and in the Web itself, it is difficult to predict exactly what the future holds, but for the Web/HTML version of Dublin Core described here to be most useful, the following developments need to be pursued:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><a name="html">HTML</a></h4><p>The current practice of inserting Dublin Core metadata within HTML's &lt;<a href="http://www.sandia.gov/sci_compute/elements.html#META">META</a>&gt; tag certainly works, but enhancements to the existing definition of this tag should be encouraged in order to enable more legible representations whereby the current</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>&lt;META NAME="DC.author" CONTENT="(TYPE=email) A.P.Miller@newcastle.ac.uk"&gt;</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>might be replaced by</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>&lt;META NAME = "DC.author"
      TYPE = "email"
      CONTENT = "A.P.Miller@newcastle.ac.uk"&gt;
</pre>
<p>Whilst the latter form is accepted by the current generation of Web browser, it breaks the Document Type Description (DTD) for HTML, and therefore does not pass the majority of HTML validation tools currently used by Web authors.</p><p><a name="create"></a></p><h4><a name="create">Metadata creation</a></h4><p>At present, although tools exist for the creation of metadata conforming to some of the more complex schemes, Dublin Core-style metadata must be entered by hand. Work is currently underway within projects such as the European-funded <a href="http://www.nic.surfnet.nl/surfnet/projects/desire/">DESIRE</a> (McDonald <i>pers comm</i>) to investigate means by which much of this metadata creation may be automated (<a href="metadata-masses.html#mcdonald_96">McDonald 1996</a>). Such automation will undoubtedly make the creation and upkeep of useful metadata more straightforward, and therefore hopefully more commonplace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><a name="search2">Search Engines</a></h4><p>As discussed <a href="metadata-masses.html#search">above</a>, many of the web search engines allow the inclusion of limited metadata within the &lt;<a href="http://www.sandia.gov/sci_compute/elements.html#HEAD">HEAD</a>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.sandia.gov/sci_compute/elements.html#HEAD">/HEAD</a>&gt; area, but this metadata is only fully used if it is in the syntax recommended for that particular engine. While representatives of several of the search engine producing companies are involved in Dublin Core development, none has yet modified their software to make full use of Dublin Core-compliant web pages. Such a development cannot be far off in happening.</p><p><a name="conc"></a></p><hr><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The world of digital metadata is a complex one, currently in a state of rapid flux. As I sit in sunny Newcastle typing the last of this paper, e-mail messages continue to arrive from various lists that threaten to force a rethink of my ideas. With deadlines looming, and demonstrating a remarkable degree of willpower, I ignore these latest ideas in order to actually get this article finished in time.</p><p>As such, it is impossible to say that the implementation of Dublin Core demonstrated here is exactly the one that will be recommended six months down the road, but given all the hard work that has gone into deriving the current offering any evolution is likely to be slight. The next stage is to continue exploring different uses of the Dublin Core idea, and to approach standards bodies with a view to ratifying something in the near future.</p><p>As exactly the type of person for whom Dublin Core could offer so much, it would be extremely useful if Ariadne readers could begin to implement Dublin Core metadata in their web pages, and report back on any of the shortcomings that they discover. If you start now, you'll be a part of a growing and exciting trend, whereby all the <i>data</i> available out on the Web might actually become <i>information</i>, and therefore of use to the wider community. <a name="refs"> </a></p><hr><p><a name="refs"> </a></p><h3><a name="refs">A selection of useful references</a></h3><p>Not all of these references are actually cited in the article, but they do form a useful introduction to some of the issues behind the use of metadata in resource description.</p><p><a name="beckett_96">Beckett, D.J.</a>, 1996, <i>Using Dublin Core Metadata</i>, Draft <b>0.1</b>, URL: <a href="http://www.hensa.ac.uk/pub/metadata/dc-
