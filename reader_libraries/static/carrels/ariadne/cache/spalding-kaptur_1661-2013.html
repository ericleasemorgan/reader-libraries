        <p>KAPTUR (2011-13) [<a href="garrett-et-al.html#1">1</a>], funded by Jisc and led by the Visual Arts Data Service, was a collaborative project involving four institutional partners: the Glasgow School of Arts; Goldsmiths, University of London; University for the Creative Arts; and the University of the Arts London.&nbsp;Research data have in recent years become regarded as a valuable institutional resource and their appropriate collection, curation, publication and preservation as essential. This has been driven by a number of internal and external forces, and all UK Research Councils now require it as a condition of funding [<a href="garrett-et-al.html#2">2</a>]. As a result, a network of data repositories has emerged [<a href="garrett-et-al.html#3">3</a>], some funded by research councils and others by institutions themselves. However, at the outset of the project, research data management practice within the visual arts appeared to operate rather <em>ad hoc</em> with none of the specialist arts institutions within the UK having either implemented research data management policies [<a href="garrett-et-al.html#4">4</a>] or established research data management systems.&nbsp; KAPTUR sought to:</p><ul><li>investigate the nature of visual arts research data;</li><li>make recommendations for its effective management;</li><li>develop a model of best practice applicable to both specialist institutions and arts departments within multidisciplinary institutions; and</li><li>apply, test and refine the model of best practice across the four institutional partner institutions.</li></ul><p>This paper outlines the background and context of the project; explores the nature of visual arts research data; details the outcomes of the user and technical review; and describes the work which underwent within the partner institutions around policy formation and staff engagement.</p><p>Led by the Visual Arts Data Service (VADS), in collaboration with the Glasgow School of Art, Goldsmiths College, University of the Arts London and University for the Creative Arts, and funded by Jisc, KAPTUR [<a href="garrett-et-al.html#1">1</a>] sought to ‘...discover, create and pilot a sectoral model of best practice in the management of research data in the [visual] arts.’ [<a href="garrett-et-al.html#5">5</a>].</p><p style="text-align: center; "><img alt="logo Visual Arts Data Service (VADS)" src="../../images/issue71-garrett-et-al/logo-2.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 210px;" title="logo Visual Arts Data Service (VADS)"></p><p>Recent years have witnessed an increasing recognition across the Higher Education sector that research data are a valuable resource and therefore its appropriate curation and preservation are essential.&nbsp; In addition, wider societal and political forces meant that research councils, teams and researchers were coming under increasing pressure to make publicly funded data freely available.&nbsp; As such the publication of research data was increasingly becoming a requirement of funding, for example the Arts and Humanities Research Council [<a href="garrett-et-al.html#6">6</a>] and Medical Research Council [<a href="garrett-et-al.html#7">7</a>]. Equally important was the need for increased data transparency, and to enable researchers to access existing datasets to test the validity and reliability of the data and associated research methods; to reinterpret the data; and to preserve the data for future scrutiny. In response, many universities, for example the University of Edinburgh, had established institutional research data management systems to support the deposit and preservation of research data, whilst others were in the process of piloting services, for example the University of Leicester, and establishing policies and procedures which actively support researchers to manage their data effectively, such as Canterbury Christ Church University and Northumbria University. In addition, many of the research councils themselves had established repositories, for example the UK Data Archive at the University of Essex, which curates research data in the social sciences and humanities, and the Natural Environment Research Council, which supports a network of data centres across its disciplinary areas.</p><p>However, given the emerging landscape, at the outset of the project it was clear that very little was known about the collection, curation and usage of research data in the visual arts:&nbsp;none of the specialist arts institutions had research data management policies or infrastructure in place and evidence collected at the time indicated that practice was at best, <em>ad hoc</em>, left to individual researchers and teams with limited support or guidance. Little work had been undertaken to understand the distinctive and varied nature of research data in the visual arts, and even less to understand how these data could be collected, curated, preserved and exploited, or their potential impact assessed.</p><p>By its very nature, research in the visual arts is highly complex and varied, often comprising a wide variety of outputs and formats which present researchers, repository managers and institutions with many discipline-specific difficulties. The methods and processes which generate this research are just as varied and complex.&nbsp; Research endeavour in the visual arts relies heavily on the physical artefact: sketchbooks, logbooks, journals, and workbooks.&nbsp; Alongside these data, a wide range of related project documentation and protocols are also created.&nbsp; While technology may offer considerable potential to support the safe storage and preservation of research and related data, and to enhance access, the highly distinctive nature of the visual arts and its research methods also present enormous technical problems with regard to formats, standards, roles and responsibilities, and policies.</p><p><!--break--></p><h2>Why Is Research Data Important in the Visual Arts?</h2><p>With two powerful opposing forces at work: external pressures and enormous technical challenges, the first step was to articulate clearly why the collection, curation, publication and preservation of research data in the visual arts were so important.&nbsp; The following factors were identified:</p><ul><li>they satisfy funders’ requirements and demands for open access;</li><li>they would help to demystify research methods and outputs, and the arts themselves;</li><li>they are extremely time-consuming and therefore costly, and their lack of discoverability or loss are inefficient;</li><li>they may have a significant application and value far beyond the cost of their collection with outcomes which could have gone unrecognised in the initial investigation;</li><li>they would enable other researchers to test the reliability and validity of the data and method;</li><li>open access to research data would support their reuse and facilitate new interpretations, thereby adding value to, and enhancing the impact of, the original data;</li><li>the publication of data would enable their impact to be tracked more accurately;</li><li>they would enable researchers and semantic web tools to make new links more easily between isolated and previously undiscoverable datasets;</li><li>they would extend collaborative opportunities to create new research opportunities between researchers and teams working on similar and related datasets;</li><li>they would enable researchers, departments and institutions to maximise the value of limited public funding in research, and to showcase and maximise the impact of the arts in the forthcoming Research Excellence Framework (REF).</li></ul><p>On this basis the appropriate curation and management of research data in the visual arts is therefore not only desirable but essential.&nbsp; KAPTUR became reality.</p><h2>What Are Research Data in the Visual Arts?</h2><p>The first task was to explore the nature and scope of research data in the visual arts.&nbsp; The variety and complexity of research outputs in the visual arts is well documented through work undertaken by the Jisc-funded KULTUR (2007-09); KULTIVATE (2010-11) and eNova (2011) projects. As such, at the time of writing the KAPTUR proposal, the team hypothesised that the complexity of research data in the visual arts mirrored that found in the resulting outputs, and a cursory exploration revealed they take many forms both physical and virtual. However, on reflection, this was an innocent trivialisation of the issues requiring much greater exploration.&nbsp; The project team spent a considerable amount of time exploring the question: What are research data in the visual arts?&nbsp; The environmental analysis was quick to identify the initial problem, terminology. The term ‘research data’ is not understood by visual researchers or their institutions. This was overcome to a certain extent by describing what visual arts research data are, by using examples.&nbsp; Further on, the team did attempt a definition, however discussions were ongoing throughout the lifetime of the project. Looking in greater depth, the environmental analysis revealed that the nature of visual arts research data can be: tangible and intangible; digital and physical; heterogeneous and infinite; and complex and complicated [<a href="garrett-et-al.html#8">8</a>].</p><p style="text-align: center; "><img alt="Figure 1: Denise Wren, 21 small tiles used to demonstrate different saltglaze tests on stoneware, 1960s. © Rosemary Wren/Crafts Study Centre 2004.

Although other subject disciplines such as engineering have reported a wide variety of research data types and file formats [<a href="garrett-et-al.html#10">10</a>], visual arts data are equally, if not more complex and diverse due to the nature of artistic research.&nbsp; Artistic research is relatively new compared to other disciplines, arising from the introduction of practice-based research degrees in the 1990s.&nbsp; As a result, research methodologies are borrowed or adapted from other disciplines, such as the social sciences, and often new and innovative research methods are developed.&nbsp; Gray and Delday describe the process of artistic research as, ‘...never a smooth and homogenous process but fluid, “wet” and folded, if not at times messy, fuzzy and tumultuous.’ (cited Mey 2010) [<a href="garrett-et-al.html#11">11</a>]. Therefore the nature of visual arts research data is potentially infinite, never-ending. This is particularly the case with artistic research that is based on ‘the self’, as Gemmell and Giddens describe, ‘We are always in a state of becoming, always unfinished.’ (cited in Griffiths, 2010) [<a href="garrett-et-al.html#12">12</a>].&nbsp; One of the interviewees described their research process as much more of a continuum, without necessarily distinct or distinguished stages, but with ‘organisational moments’; at these points research data might be actualised as a natural part of the research process such as writing or ‘trials in the studio’.&nbsp; ‘Organisational moments’ might include: compiling materials for an exhibition; externally imposed information required for the institution or funders; making a grant application, writing a paper; institutional duties such as lectures, tutorials, or other learning and teaching events; or filing information.&nbsp; What became evident during the course of the environmental analysis was the enormous value visual arts researchers placed on their data and the requirement they had to share these data.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><img alt="Figure 3: Lucie Rie, Sketches in pencil, ink, and watercolour, 1910s.

One interviewee reported, ‘[my practice is] complex and complicated. [For my PhD] I thought I was doing sculpture, I ended up doing book design and photography and now I'm involved in performance practice more than anything else [...]’.&nbsp; This confirmed the findings of the Kultivate (2011) Project [<a href="garrett-et-al.html#13">13</a>]; Gray describes a workflow tested in conjunction with the researcher which was ‘designed to support the archiving of live artwork’. This resulted in the creation of a ‘granular catalogue record (or ‘score’)’ which included, ‘videos of the performance, video interviews with the artist, scans of related promotional material, [and] digital photographs of objects involved’ [<a href="garrett-et-al.html#14">14</a>].</p><p style="text-align: center; "><img alt="Figure 4: Lucie Rie, Loose sheet with sketches of pots in blue biro.

The implication is either that a programme of digitisation is required for future research data, or that at least metadata records will be required for physical research data which include access information. A useful point to consider is that the research data of today may well be the special collections of the future (cited in Murtagh, 2011 [<a href="garrett-et-al.html#16">16</a>]). Taking the example of the Stanley Kubrick Archive which is housed in the University Archives and Special Collections Centre, University of the Arts London, ‘...a staggering collection of some 800 large boxes containing scripts, stills, props, posters, costumes, documents, equipment and a vast library of books…’ [<a href="garrett-et-al.html#17">17</a>]. This was evidence from the project team, where one interviewee noted:</p><p>‘...I’m just like anyone else I’ve got boxes of stuff, I’ve got a garden shed and then I’ve got files, I’ve got electronic files and I’ve got physical files, I’ve got ring binders full of clippings, full of photographs, and I’ve got documents of exhibitions that I’ve been in, I’ve got catalogues of exhibitions I’ve been to…’.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><img alt="Figure 5: Katharine Pleydell-Bouverie, Small vase, used as a sample for an ash glaze, stoneware, box ash glaze, 1930s.

As part of the research process, research data may be collated in a structured way to create a dataset to substantiate a particular interpretation, analysis or argument. A dataset may or may not lead to a research output, which regardless of method of presentation, is a planned public statement of new knowledge or interpretation.”[<a href="garrett-et-al.html#18">18</a>].</p><p>The nature of research data presents a unique series of challenges to researchers, curators and institutions seeking to collect, manage, use and preserve research data in the visual arts, many aspects of which the project team when on to explore further.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><img alt="Figure 6: Rhodes, Zandra (1981).

The Renaissance/Gold Collection</strong> [<a href="http://www.vads.ac.uk/large.php?uid=200470">Jacket</a>]<br><strong>© Zandra Rhodes 2012</strong></p><h2>User and Technical Analysis</h2><p>Following the publication of the environmental assessment report, the Technical Project Manager embarked on a series of interviews with the four Project Officers and information technology staff at each partner institution, with the purpose of creating a user requirement for the curation and preservation of research data in the visual arts. Based on the user requirement, the team identified seventeen potential systems which could be relevant to the curation and preservation of visual arts research data.&nbsp; Using a basic scoring mechanism, based on one point per requirement, five of these systems were identified as potential solutions and selected for further detailed analysis. Further analysis was undertaken by means of an online questionnaire whereby the Project Officers were asked to prioritise each of the requirements using a scoring method in order to calculate a more accurate score for each of the five potential solutions.&nbsp; As a result EPrints, figshare and DataStage were selected as the preferred best options for partners to consider when selecting their system for curating visual arts research data.</p><p>However, none of the three systems provided a single solution which could fulfil all the requirements of researchers, research teams, and their host institutions. Therefore, to appreciate and understand fully how best to meet the research data management requirements of researchers and their institutions, it was recommended that two pilots were undertaken in parallel: an integration of figshare with EPrints; and DataFlow's DataStage with EPrints.</p><p>In addition to the planned user and technical review, the project team was asked by the Steering Group to develop an IT costing model.&nbsp; This was circulated and used by the partners to estimate the infrastructure costs associated with research data management over the short to long term.&nbsp; The model was also disseminated more widely and generated considerable interest from the wider sector.</p><p>Following ratification of the technical analysis by the partners, the team set up two pilot services. The first was an instance of DataStage to EPrints and a second, an instance of figshare with EPrints. The partners undertook an evaluation of both these instances and it was agreed that neither was a viable option within the visual arts. Therefore it was agreed, at a late stage in the project, following the adopted methodology, to pilot an instance of CKAN with EPrints.</p><p>The team discovered that the combination of CKAN and EPrints was the most likely infrastructure solution for the visual arts because: of its sustainability model; being open-source; while its licensing model was more flexible than the previous options which had been considered.&nbsp; However, ultimately, when trying to move beyond the pilot, the team was confounded by a series of technical integration challenges and finally by the deadline of the project itself, leaving project partners better informed and to continue to explore the issue of infrastructure.</p><h2>Institutional Embedding</h2><p>Sustainability was a core element of the project; the partners adopted an embedded approach with Project Officers from each of the four institutions being seconded from existing posts. This ensured&nbsp; that emerging knowledge, skills and practice were embedded and sustained within each institution.&nbsp; In addition, the project benefited from the appointment of senior representatives at each partner institution to provide strategic leadership and governance at a high level across their respective institution.</p><h3>Policy Formation</h3><p>This was a highly complex process for each partner, partly due to terminology and lack of clarity over the nature of research data in the visual arts but also due to lack of awareness of the requirements of funders, and the costs involved.&nbsp; Policy formation was highly dependent upon existing institutional regulations, contractual obligations, practices, policies and procedures, which in some instances required consideration and review beforehand.&nbsp; This was compounded by staff changes and other demands and priorities which faced institutions.&nbsp; However, directed by emerging funder requirements, the project team reviewed the emerging policy landscape&nbsp; across the sector and with the support of the Project Sponsors, all four partner institutions were successful in developing high-level research data management policies, three of which were approved by their respective institutions by the conclusion of the project, whilst the final policy was working its way through the approval system.</p><h3>Skills Development</h3><p>The team developed two session outlines, each one hour in duration.&nbsp; The first looked at the basic principles of research data management in the visual arts and the second focused on the creation of a research data management plan.&nbsp; This was developed by each partner into a pilot course using appropriate content and resources from their respective institutions bearing in mind their particular organisational practices, process and disciplinary areas.&nbsp; Each partner worked with different groups, so across the project, participants included early-career researchers, research students, established researchers and professional support colleagues from a range of departmental perspectives.&nbsp; Feedback from the participants was favourable, and evaluation demonstrated that their understanding of research data management had improved or improved considerably.&nbsp; Facilitators also noted that participants appreciated the importance of communication between departments and the need for a cohesive institutional approach.</p><p>The materials and feedback were then shared and reviewed by the project team and a series of online resources collated to form three digital toolkits to be hosted online and shared with the wider Higher Education community.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><img alt="Figure 7: Rie, Lucie (1950s).

One senior manager reported:</p><p>I have benefited by learning about the techniques other institutions have used to encourage their artists to collect research data and the progress that they have made in establishing data repositories specific to the needs of creative practice researchers.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><img alt="Figure 8: Degas, Edgar (1878-1879).

Working with the University for the Creative Arts, the Glasgow School of Art and Falmouth University, the team has been successful in securing funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council to create a skills development package to support postgraduate and early careers researchers within the visual arts to manage their research data effectively.&nbsp; But further work will undoubtedly be needed on an ongoing basis as knowledge and practice emerges while the knowledge and skills of librarians, curators, information managers and senior managers will also need to be addressed.</p><h2>References</h2><ol><li><a name="1"></a>KAPTUR (2011-13) Project Web site <a href="http://www.vads.ac.uk/kaptur/index.html">http://www.vads.ac.uk/kaptur/index.html</a> (retrieved 18 June 2013)</li><li><a name="2"></a>RCUK (2012).
