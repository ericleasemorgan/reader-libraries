        <p><a href="../../author/richard-goodman-author-profile.html">Richard Goodman</a> gives a conference report from Educause 2018 held in Denver, Colorado, USA, a vast conference looking at the breadth of technology available for use in educational organisations and their libraries.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>In 2018, I was one of the lucky recipients of a UCISA bursary, which
enabled me to attend the Educause conference in Denver, Colorado. The
Educause conference is something that has been on my radar for 20
years, and it’s no coincidence that it is celebrating 20 years this
year. The younger me would have been overawed at the sheer size of
this event, but after having presented at and attended conferences for
the last 20 years, I felt ready for it.</p>

<p>It was an absolutely enormous event, with around 8,000 attendees
registered in 2018. That’s over 10 times larger than most of the UK
conferences in this area, which is why they need a venue the size of
the Colorado Convention Centre to host it. I sought advice from past
attendees (including past UCISA bursary recipients), and one common
theme was &ldquo;be prepared, don&rsquo;t be overwhelmed&rdquo; as well as being ready
to cope with very long days.</p>

<p>Educause brings together many thousands of people under the broad
heading of technology in education, with a broad mix of attendees from
junior learning developers through to project managers and all the way
up to CIOs and CTOs. UCISA very helpfully hold an informal networking
event for UK attendees, and this was very useful for putting faces to
some of the people that I had been interacting with on Twitter in the
weeks leading up to the conference.</p>

<p>The backdrop to this conference is of a world which has various parts
in chaos. In the UK HE sector, 2018 was a very tricky year, with a
once-in-a-generation strike affecting much of the sector (concerning
pensions), and institutions looking for more and better systems to
support and improve the experiences of students whilst at
university. Blockchain is background noise. Cloud is commonplace
now. The MOOC bubble has burst (in the UK at least).</p>

<p>One of the big themes of the conference was around diversity, equity
and inclusion. These are areas that have resonated in many places in
the last few years, even though the political arena (in the UK and the
US at least) appears to have veered off in the opposite direction to
this agenda right now. The opening keynote from Michele Norris,
talking about the Race Card project, reflected this theme. This is the
first time I’ve ever been to a keynote at a venue that has seen Bruce
Springsteen, Diana Ross, Elton John, Neil Young and Tori Amos taking
to the very same stage.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img alt src="../../images/issue78-goodman/figure1.jpg" style="width: 640px;  border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;"></p>

<p>I threw myself in headlong to each day of the conference, up at silly
o’clock every morning to take part in “brain dates”, sharing
experiences of learning technology with international colleagues from
universities and colleges, and a nice gentleman from a start up
company who are looking to get into the world of online learning with
an interesting web tool. The tables and chairs inside the corrugated
cardboard booths were perfectly pleasant. The 1970s “Barbarella” style
swinging chairs were less conducive to a friendly chat.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img alt src="../../images/issue78-goodman/figure2.jpg" style="width: 640px;  border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;"></p>

<p>However, nothing was as bad as the chairs made out of skis, which were
massively uncomfortable and almost impossible to get out of! You might
also spot some swings in the background - it’s hard to talk about
serious subjects when wobbling around on a swing!</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img alt src="../../images/issue78-goodman/figure3.jpg" style="width: 640px;  border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;"></p>

<p>The conference schedule was absolutely crammed with loads of
conflicting sessions, and it’s the sign of an engaging conference when
there’s so much to go to and too much to choose from. I hope I made
the right choices, but I’ll never know. Sessions on learning analytics
dashboards, student data, accessibility, ITIL, change management,
projects and relationships, privacy and ethics and onboarding were
certainly a varied bunch, with a good mix of listening and more
interactive sessions. The conference was utterly exhausting but hugely
rewarding.</p>

<p>The exhibition was enormous. There were 333 exhibition stands to
choose from, with multiple Google stands (including half a basketball
court), an enormous Service Now stand and plenty of the usual suspects
with massive stands (costing $57,000 for the largest ones!) Technology
has become a tool which guides change and there&rsquo;s big money to be made
through securing a new contract with a new institution.</p>

<p>It was far more interesting to me to talk to the smaller providers and
those in &ldquo;start up alley&rdquo;. Once you’ve seen the latest laptop from
Lenovo or Dell or a Microsoft Surface, you’ve seen enough shiny fondle
slabs to last you for a year. There were some familiar faces on the
Moodle stand, as well as a few other suppliers who I could chat with
about existing projects. It was very handy for one particular project
we were working on at the time, as I could show something to the
supplier which they could relay back to their implementation team, as
we both happened to be in the same time zone for the first time in the
project lifecycle.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s so much still to reflect upon and that will happen naturally
over the next year when thinking back to some of these conference
experiences and the presentations that were shared. There was a very
lively social media community on the #edu18 hashtag too. Communication
and collaboration have been key themes that have resonated long since
the conference finished.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with a last image of Colorado, a very slight glimpse of
the Rocky Mountains that have always been visible from somewhere each
day. This was the view from the A-Train (officially called the
University of Colorado A Line for sponsorship reasons) from Denver to
the airport.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img alt src="../../images/issue78-goodman/figure4.jpg" style="width: 640px;  border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;"></p>

<p>A fantastic conference experience in an amazing city. Before coming
here I would never have put Denver on my &ldquo;cities to visit&rdquo;
list. Having been here, I&rsquo;m eager to come back and explore more one
day. It’s very much an &ldquo;outdoor city&rdquo; with so much provision for
walking and cycling, far more than I’d been expecting. Wherever you
turn, there are people speeding along pavements on scooters. You can
explore so much on foot, or catch trains, buses and trams to get
around the city and beyond.</p>
