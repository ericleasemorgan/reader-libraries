It will also explore the different types of vocabulary (taxonomies, thesauri, ontologies, etc.) that may be used for labelling the subject content of our resources. We&rsquo;ll be looking very practically at how to handle the vocabulary tools, in order to achieve integrated information management. Examples and exercises will be drawn from public and private sector applications.</p><p>The programme will include:</p><ul><li>Different metadata schemas - key features and applications</li><li>Controlled vocabularies - choosing the type of vocabulary we need</li><li>Mapping between vocabularies</li><li>Human indexing or automatic categorisation?</li><li>Software for vocabulary maintenance and use</li><li>Progress towards the Semantic Web?</li><li>The role of social tagging/folksonomies</li><li>Return on investment (ROI) - how do we justify the effort?</li><li>Bringing it all together in a plan</li></ul><p>The course will include a combination of presentations and practical exercises, with participation encouraged and plenty of opportunity for questions and answers.</p><h3>Who Should Attend</h3><p>Anyone who is planning efficient ways of managing information flows around the organisation should attend. Likewise webmasters who want to maximise the impact of the resources on their websites, especially by presenting them so that users can find what they want and external portals can harvest the information. Effective implementation of metadata relies on cooperative working between information professionals and their information technology colleagues, and it is good to have both sides of the house represented.</p><h3>Course Presenter</h3><p>A Fellow of CILIP, Stella Dextre Clarke is an independent consultant who specialises in the design and implementation of controlled vocabularies for private and public sector clients. While working with the Cabinet Office, she played a key role in development of the UK&rsquo;s e-Government Metadata Standard and built the Integrated Public Sector Vocabulary which forms part of it. In 2006 she won the Tony Kent Strix Award (sponsored by UKeiG), for outstanding contributions to the field of information retrieval.</p><p>To book a place please contact Christine Baker (see below) or visit<br><a href="http://www.ukeig.org.uk/training/2008/July/UnderstandingMetadata.html">http://www.ukeig.org.uk/training/2008/July/UnderstandingMetadata.html</a></p><p>Christine Baker,<br>UKeiG Administration,<br>Piglet Cottage,<br>Redmire,<br>LEYBURN,<br>DL8 4EH,<br>North Yorkshire,<br>United Kingdom<br>Tel &amp; Fax: +44 (0)1969 625751<br>Email: <a href="mailto:cabaker@ukeig.org.uk">cabaker@ukeig.org.uk</a></p><p align="right"><br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events4"></a></p><h3>JISC/CNI 2008</h3><p>The JISC/CNI Meeting: Transforming the User Experience<br>Hastings Europa Hotel, Belfast<br>10-11 July 2008<br><a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/events/jisc-cni-2008/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/events/jisc-cni-2008/</a></p><p>Following the success of previous conferences held in Brighton and York, The Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) and the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI) are proud to announce the 7th International Meeting which will be held at the Europa Hastings Hotel, Belfast, on 10 and 11 July 2008.</p><p>The meeting will bring together experts from the United States, Europe and the United Kingdom.

We need to ask:</p><ul><li>How does the availability of services by Web 2.0 companies affect the existing provision of institutional Web services?</li><li>Are Web 2.0 services a distraction to traditional, well-managed high-quality Web resources or do they signal the direction for in-house development activities?</li><li>Are Web 2.0 companies and others in a position to provide a credible and sustainable alternative to institutional services?</li><li>Has the vision of the &ldquo;network as the computer&rdquo; arrived, providing users with choice in their selection of services?</li><li>How is the role of the institutional Web manager changing?</li><li>What does this debate tell us about the role of the Higher Education institution in a globally networked environment?</li></ul><p>These are some of the issues our institutions are currently facing.

The goal of the workshop is promoting exchange of ideas concerning creation, curation, storage, retrieval and use of cultural heritage information. In particular, the workshop will focus on the question of how the keepers of cultural heritage resources can improve information access by applying information technology and principles currently being developed in the area of information access.</p><p>Following current trends, users are actively engaging with cultural heritage on the Web, prompting heritage institutions to stimulate communities to grow around them. The workshop places an additional emphasis on active user participation, which creates new modes of access and contextualisation. These are challenging developments for cultural heritage organisations, due both to the variety and richness of cultural heritage resources and to the diverse range of users with varying information needs and search behaviours.</p><p>Issues in the scope of the workshop include:</p><p>1. Emerging communities of users of cultural heritage information</p><ul><li>User-generated content and metadata</li><li>Online user communities</li><li>Drawing in wider audiences for cultural heritage collections</li><li>Understanding and modelling diverse user needs</li><li>User interaction and interface design</li><li>Visualisation of cultural heritage resources</li></ul><p>2. Information retrieval technology for improved access to cultural heritage resources</p><ul><li>Exploiting user contributions in the representation and indexing of cultural heritage information</li><li>Retrieval of structured and unstructured text</li><li>Multimedia retrieval (images, video, audio,&hellip;)</li><li>Access to distributed repositories</li><li>Access to multilingual resources</li><li>Evaluation and test collections</li></ul><p>3. Innovative solutions for accessing cultural heritage on-line</p><ul><li>Case studies</li></ul><p>4. Panel session focused on identifying key challenges facing access to cultural information today.</p><ul><li>Position papers</li></ul><p>We welcome the submission poster papers, position papers (for panel participation) and extended abstracts (i.e., proposals for full papers) which should be written in English and prepared according to the Springer LNCS format guidelines. Submissions should be a maximum of 2 pages and manuscripts should be in PDF format.

However, there is a still a need to provide practical hands-on training in a life cycle approach to conceptualising, creating, preserving access to and re-using data over time. The Digital Curation Centre is developing a new residential programme to deliver practical training and develop these skills amongst the information services and scientific communities. The DCC Digital Curation 101 training programme will take place in Edinburgh in October 2008. It will produce a dynamic, practical, replicable, and extendable educational framework that will provide participants with the skills they will need to conceptualise, create, manage, describe, store, and reuse data over time.</p><p>Participation in DC101 will introduce attendees to the DCC Digital Curation Life-Cycle Model and provide them with a firm understanding of the individual role(s) they play in this life-cycle over time. The training programme will focus on the practical, rather than the theoretical, and will contribute towards bridging the gap that currently exists between a general awareness of curation and preservation issues amongst the information services and scientific community, and their ability to practically address digital curation and preservation challenges within their actual working environment.</p><p>In addition, DC101 will offer students an opportunity to network with other scientific researchers, international experts, and practitioners across disciplinary and national boundaries.

The last such agreement resulted in over £3.5m savings for public libraries in England.</p><p>The ground-breaking Reference Online initiative was originally launched in February 2006 with the intention of finding ways in which public libraries in England could provide their users with the best possible range of online resources at the most economic price and to streamline the procurement process for both libraries and suppliers. The second Reference Online Framework Agreement, which comes into force this month, offers subscription opportunities to all public libraries in England. The 2008 agreement will last for four years and sees an increase in the number of MLA-approved suppliers to 22 and the number of products double to fifty.</p><p>The resources offered for libraries to choose from via Reference Online include general reference material, business, legal and financial information, subject-based encyclopaedias, dictionaries, directories, serials, newspapers and newspaper archives, and - for the first time - materials for children and streamed music services. Materials to which libraries subscribe will be available either in the library or remotely <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> to anyone with library membership.</p><p>Roy Clare said: &ldquo;MLA&rsquo;s Reference Online programme enables library services to purchase world class online resources at lower costs. The agreement opens up a huge amount of reference material to library users both at home and in their local library. It also represents very good value for money and I welcome very warmly the successful outcome of a great deal of work by Susi Woodhouse of the MLA, and others who have supported her in negotiating this outcome.&rdquo;</p><p>For further information, including a full list of all available products and services visit <a href="http://www.mla.gov.uk/programmes/digital_initiatives/reference_online">http://www.mla.gov.uk/programmes/digital_initiatives/reference_online</a></p><p>[Source: MLA]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: April 2008</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news2"></a></p><h3>Relaunch of Online Resource Provides Access to Visual Arts Collections</h3><p>Students and academics looking for visual arts images now have online access to a collection of over 100,000 images with the launch of the Web site at: <a href="http://www.vads.ac.uk/">http://www.vads.ac.uk/</a></p><p>The Web site has been developed by VADS (Visual Arts Data Service) which rebranded and re-launched itself in April 2008 and contains collections as diverse as the National Inventory of Continental European Paintings, the Woolmark Company Archive, and the Central Saint Martins Museum and Study Collection.</p><p>VADS has been providing services to the academic community for some 11 years and has built up a portfolio of visual art collections.

The award was presented to him during the fourth Nordic Conference on Scholarly Communications at the University of Lund, Sweden. Over recent years Leo Waaijers has proved himself an advocate for open access to research results via the Internet for SURF, the collaborative organisation for Higher Education institutions and research institutes aimed at breakthrough innovations in ICT.</p><p>SPARC encourages better communication between researchers and between the scientific community and the public. By presenting Leo Waaijers with this award, the jury has acknowledged his unceasing efforts to promote open access to research results via the Internet. It was under his leadership that SURF&rsquo;s DARE Programme created DAREnet, which provides access to the 150,000 publications contained in the repositories of all the Dutch universities. More than a hundred publications are added every day.</p><p>Waaijers&rsquo; influence is not limited to the Netherlands. DAREnet has made the country a frontrunner in Europe and has served as the model for the European DRIVER programme. Waaijers also initiated the successful petition asking the European Commission to guarantee public access to publicly financed research results. The petition garnered worldwide support.</p><p>This is the third SPARC Europe Award for Outstanding Achievements in Scholarly Communications. The first Award, in 2006, went to the UK&rsquo;s Wellcome Trust (which finances medical research provided that the results are published via Open Access) and the second, in 2007, went to the SHERPA Group (the University of Nottingham&rsquo;s Open Access programme). This is the first time that the Award has been presented to an individual.</p><p>For more information:<br>SURFshare programme: <a href="http://www.surf.nl/surfshare">http://www.surf.nl/surfshare</a></p><p>SURF&rsquo;s view on Open: <a href="http://www.surf.nl/en/OverSURF/Pages/SURFenOpen.aspx">http://www.surf.nl/en/OverSURF/Pages/SURFenOpen.aspx</a></p><p>SPARC Europe: <a href="http://www.sparceurope.nl">http://www.sparceurope.nl</a></p><p>DRIVER: <a href="http://www.driver-community.eu">http://www.driver-community.eu</a></p><p>EC Open Access petition: <a href="http://www.ec-petition.eu/">http://www.ec-petition.eu/</a></p><p>Leo Waaijers has written for <em>Ariadne</em>:<br>&ldquo;The DARE Chronicle: Open Access to Research Results and Teaching Material in the Netherlands&rdquo; by Leo Waaijers, October 2007, <em>Ariadne</em> Issue 53<br><a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue53/waaijers/">http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue53/waaijers/</a></p><p>Other relevant articles in <em>Ariadne</em>:<br>Article Title: &ldquo;DRIVER: Building the Network for Accessing Digital Repositories across Europe&rdquo;<br>Authors: Martin Feijen, Wolfram Horstmann, Paolo Manghi, Mary Robinson and Rosemary Russell<br>Publication Date: 30-October-2007 Publication: <em>Ariadne</em> Issue 53<br>Originating URL: <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue53/feijen-et-al/">http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue53/feijen-et-al/</a></p><p>Article Title: &ldquo;DRIVER: Seven Items on a European Agenda for Digital Repositories&rdquo;<br>Author: Maurits van der Graaf<br>Publication Date: 30-July-2007 Publication: <em>Ariadne</em> Issue 52<br>Originating URL: <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue52/vandergraf/">http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue52/vandergraf/</a></p><p>Article Title: &ldquo;A Recipe for Cream of Science: Special Content Recruitment for Dutch Institutional Repositories&rdquo;<br>Author: Martin Feijen and Annemiek van der Kuil<br>Publication Date: 30-October-2005 Publication: <em>Ariadne</em> Issue 45<br>Originating URL: <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue45/vanderkuil/">http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue45/vanderkuil/</a></p><p>Article Title: &ldquo;The Dawning of the Dutch Network of Digital Academic REpositories (DARE): A Shared Experience&rdquo;<br>Author: Annemiek van der Kuil and Martin Feijen<br>Publication Date: 30-October-2004 Publication: <em>Ariadne </em>Issue 41<br>Originating URL: <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue41/vanderkuil/">http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue41/vanderkuil/</a></p><p>Article Title: &ldquo; The SURF foundation &ldquo;<br>Authors: Jaqueline Pieters Publication Date: September-1996<br>Publication: <em>Ariadne</em> Issue 5<br>Originating URL: <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue5/surf/">http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue5/surf/</a></p><p>[Source: SURF]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: April 2008</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news4"></a></p><h3>Internet2 Community Releases Shibboleth Version 2.0</h3><p>New Major Release of Open Source Federated Authentication Suite Provides Enhanced Functionality; Enables More Seamless Installation and Operation</p><p>Internet2 recently announced that it has released Shibboleth 2.0, the latest major version of a widely-deployed federated authentication implementation. Developed by the Internet2 community and its partners around the world, the latest release greatly enhances several key elements of Shibboleth in an effort to ensure interoperability with other commercial and open-source federated identity solutions; to improve personalisation and security; as well as to ease installation, management and operation processes.</p><p>The goal is to provide a more robust and interoperable platform that will help catalyze the worldwide growth of higher education and research federations like the InCommon Federation which serves the U.S. Higher Education sector and provides a framework for participating organisations to collaborate and share resources using Shibboleth technology.</p><p>&ldquo;We are grateful for the tremendous collaboration in developing this important new release and look forward to working with the worldwide Shibboleth community to further roll out and refine this technology,&rdquo; said Ken Klingenstein, Internet2 senior director of middleware and security.</p><p>Shibboleth 2.0 adds an open source implementation of the OASIS SAML 2.0 standard to the suite of protocol implementations available in previous releases. The software provides a secure, single-sign on mechanism for institutions to enable their users to access protected online resources within their campuses and from their external service provider partners while at the same time protecting individual user privacy.</p><p>Shibboleth 2.0 also adds new security features to ensure additional protection of user information. It includes encryption technology specified in the SAML 2.0 standard and provides an improved method for usage logging at the home institution to better track abuse or inappropriate use of the system.</p><p>As organisations continue to deploy identity management solutions like Shibboleth, the vision is to move these institutions and their service providers into &ldquo;trust federations.&rdquo; Federations bring together multiple organisations with common needs into one group or association to leverage the use of a common set of attributes, practices and policies to exchange information about their users and resources to simplify the management of collaborations and transactions.</p><p>To support the continued growth of federations, Shibboleth 2.0 enables organisations to seamlessly comply with a federation&rsquo;s policies and practices without changing campus directory infrastructures, and extends automated support for federation processes. For instance, as new service providers or institutions are added to a federation, new &ldquo;metadata&rdquo; is required to setup the technical exchange for collaboration. In the past, adding new metadata required IT staff to develop their own methods to update the information. Shibboleth 2.0 automatically downloads the metadata as often as the organisation specifies.</p><p>In addition, as federations continue to proliferate, it becomes increasingly important to support multiple protocols to ensure interoperability between federations. Using Shibboleth, federations and partners that use any authentication architecture built on popular standards such as SAML 2.0 and Active Directory Federation Services specifications will have the ability to interoperate and interfederate with any federation or partner using those standards.</p><p>Beyond the multi-protocol support, Shibboleth offers additional features for the Higher Education and research communities: management of attribute release policies on a site, group and user basis; policy-based management of attribute acceptance; real scalable support for large-scale federations; and strong support for application integration.</p><p><strong>Further information:</strong><br>Internet2 and its partners announced the release of Shibboleth 2.0 at the annual Internet2 Spring Member Meeting held in Arlington, VA, USA from 21-23 April 2008.

The project, now in <a href="http://hilt.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/hilt4/index.html">Phase IV</a>, is currently working to create pilot Web services that will deliver machine-readable terminology and cross-terminology mappings data likely to be useful to information services wishing to extend or enhance the efficacy of their subject search or browse services. Based on <a href="http://www.oclc.org/research/projects/webservices/default.htm">SRW/U</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/">SOAP</a>, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a>, the HILT facilities, when fully operational, will permit such services to improve their own subject search-and-browse mechanisms by using HILT data in a fashion transparent to their users. On request, HILT will serve up machine-processable data on individual subject schemes (broader terms, narrower terms, hierarchy information, preferred and non-preferred terms, and so on) and interoperability data (usually intellectual or automated mappings between schemes, but the architecture allows for the use of other methods) - data that can be used to enhance user services. The project is also developing an associated toolkit that will help service technical staff to embed HILT-related functionality into their services. The primary aim is to serve JISC-funded information services or services at JISC institutions, but information services outside the JISC domain may also find the proposed services useful and wish to participate in the test and refine process.</p><p>Although the primary focus of the work is to improve interoperability during cross-search or browse by subject, the facilities offered can also be used for other purposes. Examples of possible uses include:</p><ul><li>Providing the best terms for a subject search in a remote service that uses a subject scheme unfamiliar to &lsquo;home service&rsquo; users. HILT currently has the following KOS<a href="newsline.html#furtherinformation">*</a> mounted and available: AAT, CAB, GCMD, HASSET, IPSV, LCSH, MeSH, NMR, SCAS, UNESCO, and DDC.</li><li>Improving recall in a subject search of one or more databases by enriching the set of terms known to a user by providing synonyms and related terms.</li><li>Generating an interactive browse structure where a scheme is arranged hierarchically.</li><li>Taking a user&rsquo;s subject term and using it to identify available information services with subject coverage relevant to the query via collections and/or services databases such as <a href="http://iesr.ac.uk/">IESR</a> and <a href="http://scone.strath.ac.uk/service/">SCONE</a>.</li></ul><p>The project is also looking to test other associated facilities it intends to offer for embedding in JISC or institutional information services - for example a spell-check mechanism and machine to machine delivery of <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/">Wordnet</a> data.</p><p>The test and refine process began in April 2008 and will continue until at<br>least autumn 2008. Individuals or services interested in participating, should begin by joining the <a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=hilt-collaborators">HILT-Collaborators email list</a>.</p><p>Note that, at this stage, both the facilities and the subject schemes are only being made available for testing purposes - to allow services to help us test and refine them (and, in time, evaluate their usefulness). They cannot and should not be built into operational services.</p><p><strong>Further information:</strong><br><a name="furtherinformation"></a>Knowledge Organisation Systems: see, for example:<br><a href="http://www.db.dk/bh/lifeboat_ko/CONCEPTS/knowledge_organization_systems.htm">http://www.db.dk/bh/lifeboat_ko/CONCEPTS/knowledge_organization_systems.htm</a><br><br>HILT-Collaborators email list:<br><a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=hilt-collaborators">http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=hilt-collaborators</a></p><p><strong>HILT Contacts:</strong><br>Emma McCulloch, Project Manager <a href="mailto:e.mcculloch@strath.ac.uk">e.mcculloch@strath.ac.uk</a><br>Anu Joseph, Programmer <a href="mailto:anu.joseph@strath.ac.uk">anu.joseph@strath.ac.uk</a><br>Dennis Nicholson, Project Director <a href="mailto:d.m.nicholson@strath.ac.uk">d.m.nicholson@strath.ac.uk</a></p><p>[Source: HILT]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: April 2008</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p class="right"><a href="newsline.html#top"><small>Return to top</small></a></p><!-- this group of ssi's will work only when Ariadne 38 folder is in place with the relevant ssi files added --><p class="footer">Publication Date: 30-April-2008<br>Publication: Ariadne Issue 55<br>Originating URL: <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue55/newsline/">http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue55/newsline/</a></p></p>
