        <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue69/bunting#author1">Thom Bunting</a> explains some of the technology behind the migration of <em>Ariadne</em> (including more than 1600 articles from its back issues archive) onto a Drupal content management platform.

    <div class="content">
        <p>Tools and strategies for content management are a perennial topic in <em>Ariadne. </em> With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/category/buzz/content-management?article-type=&amp;term=&amp;organisation=&amp;project=&amp;author=" title="Link to overview of articles including references to 'content management'">more than one hundred articles</a>&nbsp;touching on content management system (CMS) technologies or techniques since this online magazine commenced publication in 1996,&nbsp;<em>Ariadne</em>&nbsp;attests to continuing interest in this topic. Authors have discussed this topic within various contexts, from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/category/buzz/content-management?article-type=&amp;term=intranet&amp;organisation=&amp;project=&amp;author=&amp;issue=#content-overview" title="Link to articles discussing 'content management', within  'intranet' context">intranets</a> to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/category/buzz/repositories?article-type=&amp;term=content+management&amp;organisation=&amp;project=&amp;author=&amp;issue=#content-overview" title="Link to overview of articles referring to 'content management', within 'repositories' context">repositories</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/category/buzz/content-management?article-type=&amp;term=web+2.0&amp;organisation=&amp;project=&amp;author=&amp;issue=#content-overview" title="Link to overview of articles discussing 'content management', within context of Web 2.0">Web 2.0</a>, &nbsp;with some notable&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/sites/all/datacharts/hc/72-chart-wp.html#timeline" title="Link to timeline: articles referring to 'content management'">surges in references to 'content management' between 2000 and 2005</a>&nbsp;(see Figure 1 below). &nbsp;Although levels of discussion are by no means trending, over recent years it is clear that&nbsp;<em>Ariadne</em> authors have taken note of and written about content management tools and techniques on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p><p>In the light of this long-established interest, it is noteworthy that&nbsp;<em>Ariadne</em> itself migrated into a content management system only recently. Although the formatting of its articles did change a few times since 1996, <em>Ariadne</em>&nbsp;remained 'hand-coded' for more than fifteen years. &nbsp;None of its articles had been migrated into a database-driven content management system until March 2012, when&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue68" title="Link to table of contents for Ariadne issue 68">issue 68</a>&nbsp;was published.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue68/editorial1" title="Editorial introduction: Welcome to New Ariadne">editorial introduction</a>&nbsp;to that first issue, launching the new content management arrangements, and as discussed in some more detail below (see 'Technical challenges in content migration'), the considerable size of&nbsp;<em>Ariadne</em>'s archive of back issues was daunting. &nbsp;With <a href="../../articles.html" title="Overview of more than 1600 articles in Ariadne">more than 1600 articles</a>&nbsp;in hand-coded 'flat'-html formats,&nbsp;the process of migration itself required careful planning to result in a seamless, graceful transition into an entirely new content management arrangement. &nbsp;Over time, the sheer size of the <em>Ariadne</em> corpus had made it both increasingly rich in content and increasingly more challenging to convert retrospectively into a database-driven CMS as the total number of articles published within this online magazine steadily expanded.&nbsp;</p><p>In looking back over the recent process of migrating <em>Ariadne</em> onto a CMS platform, this article discusses some tools and techniques used to prepare content for transfer, testing, and then re-launch. &nbsp;After explaining some of the background to and objectives of this work, this article focuses on key features of content management supported by Drupal.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;

When we needed new functions, we could usually find an existing module within the contributions. If not, we were able to quickly build our own custom module to extend the functions of our system. This extensibility, found in many open source CMSs, is critical for addressing new problems as they arise.</blockquote><p>Perhaps the most important factor in deciding to use Drupal is the very active and large community of developers engaged with its technical development, on-going testing, and collaborative support. As the overall architecture of Drupal open source is highly extensible, &nbsp;developers produce a wide range of modules that provide new functions as required. Over time, large development houses and major projects [<a href="bunting.html#6">6</a>] as well as many dedicated community programmers&nbsp;[<a href="bunting.html#7">7</a>]&nbsp;contribute to the Drupal so many useful (and sometimes increasingly small or abstracted) building blocks of functionality that it is very rarely necessary for anyone to build 'custom' modules. &nbsp;Drupal's very active community of developers provides and manages 'core' as well as 'contrib' modules in a way that minimises the need for extra programming effort.</p><p>Although it is true that Drupal offers developers (as well as technically capable users) many options for customising features and functionality through code, most use cases are easily accommodated without need for touching code. As explained on Wikipedia&nbsp;[<a href="bunting.html#8">8</a>], Drupal is amenable both to developers and to ordinary users: "Although Drupal offers a sophisticated programming interface for developers, no programming skills are required for basic website installation and administration".&nbsp;Particularly important for everyone using Drupal to manage content, the collaborative, methodically managed code base provided by the active development community can be managed administratively. &nbsp;For developers and ordinary users alike, code management arrangements coordinated via the official Drupal site can be managed easily and reliably. &nbsp;Whereas technical users have many powerful options to manage module installations, configurations, and updates very efficiently via the command-line (using 'drush'), non-technical users can use Web-based interfaces to manage receive module configurations and update notifications.</p><p>Over the years, the scope of engagement with Drupal across many sectors has increased. &nbsp;As the official <a href="http://drupal.org/about" title="Official Drupal website: About Drupal">drupal.org</a>&nbsp;site explains, a broad range of groups 'from local businesses to global organizations' use Drupal to manage content. &nbsp;In addition to the examples of major publishers, universities, and corporates using Drupal, it is noteworthy that a range of government-funded initiatives for public engagement (such as www.whitehouse.gov) and data-sharing (<a href="http://data.gov">data.gov</a> and <a href="http://data.gov.uk">data.gov.uk</a> ) as well as very large publishing sites (such as <a href="http://economist.com">economist.com</a> ) are using Drupal to run remarkably high-performance, data-rich Web sites.&nbsp;[<a href="bunting.html#9">9</a>]</p><p>As reliable access to <em>Ariadne</em>&nbsp;content remains the highest priority, the fact that Drupal has been used for years by major publishers contributed to the decision to consider it as a suitable platform. &nbsp;Although it is unlikely that <em>Ariadne</em> will become as popular as some of the Internet's busiest publishing sites, it is reassuring to know that 'a single mid range server' running Drupal can with reasonable tuning scale up to very high loads of 3.4 million page views per day [<a href="bunting.html#10">10</a>].&nbsp;</p><h2>Technical Challenges in Content Migration</h2><p>For consistency and coherence, the <em>Ariadne</em> management team decided that all articles originally published in the previous issues&nbsp;were to be migrated onto the new Drupal-based platform.&nbsp;In planning the migration of content into a more modern 'look and feel', with enhanced functionality, the decision was taken to keep intact the substance of articles 'as is'.[<a href="bunting.html#11">11</a>] The focus in this process has been on maintaining the historical integrity of more than 1600 articles in the <em>Ariadne</em> back issues archive, as these previous articles represent a substantial body of work reflecting developments in thinking and working since the commencement of publication in the relatively early days of the Web.</p><p>As the previous articles had been all 'hand-coded', with some variations of HTML related to both evolutions in standards and (occasionally) human inconsistencies, one of the first challenges was to retrieve from the 'flat-HTML' corpus the core content of articles that were to be migrated into the Drupal database structure. &nbsp;To accomplish this, a Perl script was created to scan all previous articles and extract the key elements required: article titles, authors, article summaries (used as preview / lead-in text), and the main article content. &nbsp;In this extraction process, it was necessary to transform programatically some aspects of the HTML into required formats (for example, by changing relative paths to absolute paths for site-wide consistency) and downloading images into consistently structured directories so that all Ariadne images could be managed in a consistent way.</p><p>Once this key content from the previous articles had been extracted from the 'flat-HTML' corpus, the next challenge was to import this content into the MySQL database to be used by Drupal. [<a href="bunting.html#12">12</a>]&nbsp;To achieve this we used the Feeds module, which proved very useful in mapping specific elements of content to the relevant database tables and fields. &nbsp;After setting up and testing the required mappings via the Feeds Importers interface), it was possible to import all the previous articles from the <em>Ariadne</em>&nbsp;archive into the Drupal database within a few minutes. [<a href="bunting.html#13">13</a>]</p><p>To check that all content had imported correctly and was displaying as expected in the new Drupal format, the <em>Ariadne</em> production team scanned through migrated content. &nbsp;To make this scanning process efficient, administrative views were set up to produce all-in-one overviews of all articles published in each issue so that it was easier to spot and correct any inconsistencies remaining from automated parsing of hand-coded articles. &nbsp;As part of this post-migration review process, it was relatively easy to make a range of improvements in areas such as tweaking placement of images and strengthening editorial consistency in titles across more than 1600 articles. Even though scanning by human beings was, of course, much slower than the programmatic execution of content migration that had preceded it, achievement of more thorough consistency across the entire <em>Ariadne</em> back issue archive has prepared the way for opening up this Web magazine's full range of content.&nbsp;[<a href="bunting.html#14">14</a>]</p><p><!--break--></p><h2>Extensible Toolkit: Using Drupal 'contrib' Options</h2><p>Once the previous articles from the <em>Ariadne</em> back issue archive had been imported, some key Drupal 'contrib' modules were essential to meeting the set of requirements gathered in the early planning stage of re-development work. &nbsp;Those familiar with Drupal will not be surprised that Views, Taxonomy, and Content Construction Kit (CCK)&nbsp;[<a href="bunting.html#15">15</a>]&nbsp;modules proved useful in providing essential functionality, as these modules are very widely used in many Drupal sites.&nbsp; Below is an overview of how Drupal module and theme options usefully supported required functionalities and features.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" id="500wtable" style="width: 500px;

[<a href="bunting.html#16">16</a>] &nbsp;Whilst it is by design geared for technically adept users (as it assumes understanding of database table structures, database queries, and data modelling generally), the Data module provides many options for managing directly within Drupal key sets of data that are relevant to a Web site. &nbsp;In view of the growing trends in using Drupal as front-end to data-rich Web sites, it is likely that the Data module is well positioned to help extend this further.&nbsp;</p><h2>Complementary Tools: Other Technologies and Drupal</h2><p>The process of migrating <em>Ariadne</em>&nbsp;confirmed that Drupal also integrates flexibly with a range of other technologies. &nbsp; Given that the Drupal project has its origins in mainstream LAMP developments [<a href="bunting.html#17">17</a>],&nbsp;it quite naturally lends itself to working compatibly with many other technologies that share its open source development philosophy.&nbsp; In addition to open source, however, Drupal can also integrate with other technologies.&nbsp;[<a href="bunting.html#18">18</a>]&nbsp;</p><p>The process of working on the migration of <em>Ariadne</em> content demonstrated that 'contrib' modules can seamlessly facilitate integration with a range of data interchange standards (JSON, XML, RDF) and programming libraries (JQuery, GD graphics, etc). &nbsp;Although this integration with other technologies is by no means unique to it, Drupal does have a fundamentally adaptable and extensible approach to integrating other technologies into its content management framework. [<a href="bunting.html#19">19</a>]&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, <em>Ariadne</em>&nbsp;re-development also demonstrated how Drupal lends itself to visualisation of data sets. &nbsp;As the Drupal community is actively interested in visualisation of data using recently developed libraries (such as <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill" title="TileMill website">TileMill</a> mapping and <a href="http://www.highcharts.com" title="Highcharts website">Highcharts</a> graphing libraries), quite a bit of work in this area is in progress. [<a href="bunting.html#20">20</a>] &nbsp;Given that Drupal could manage rich data sets related to usage of keywords in articles published over the more than 15 years of&nbsp;publication, after the <em>Ariadne</em>&nbsp;content migration it proved relatively easy to produce via the recently developed Highcharts libraries relevant sets of visualisations showing timelines, bar charts, scatter plots, etc.</p><p>Of course Drupal as a web-based application is also amenable to testing and tuning procedures using a range of commonly available tools. &nbsp;In preparing for re-launch, the new Drupal platform for <em>Ariadne</em> was tested repeatedly with a range of both open source (shell scripts using wget) and proprietary (ProxySniffer) [<a href="bunting.html#21">21</a>] load-testing tools after carefully tuning the Drupal application and its platform using best-practice Drupal and LAMP-standard procedures. [<a href="bunting.html#22">22</a>] &nbsp;Methodical tuning, testing, and final optimisation was facilitated by many freely available technologies relevant to checking the performance of a Drupal content management platform.&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Based on the experience of transferring, testing, and re-launching on a new&nbsp;Drupal content management platform more than 1600 articles from the <em>Ariadne</em> back issue archive, it is fair to say that Drupal technology has proven more than equal to the challenging tasks involved.</p><p>In discussing some of the planning and technical work related to this migration process, this article has attempted to provide information that may be of some usefulness and relevance to two types of readers: 1) those interested in Drupal as a content management system; 2) those interested in <em>Ariadne</em>&nbsp;as compendium of content about the Web technologies. &nbsp;Now that you as a reader have made it this far along in this article, it's likely that you are in either one of these two groups. &nbsp;If by this point you find yourself a bit more firmly situated in <em>both</em> these camps, then this article may well have served its purpose.</p><h2>References</h2><ol><li><a name="1"></a>Wikipedia provides a useful overview of Drupal as 'free and open-source content management system (CMS) and content management framework (CMF) written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General PUblic License.

only the surrounding navigational links are different.</li><li><a name="12"></a>Although most&nbsp;Drupal sites typically use MySQL databases, Drupal does provide a database abstraction layer and it (depending upon version and configuration) can support a broad range of databases including: MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, MondoDB.&nbsp;</li><li><a name="13"></a>In addition to migrations of content managed via the Feeds module (see <a href="http://drupal.org/project/feeds/" title="Drupal: feeds module">http://drupal.org/project/feeds/</a> ), &nbsp;even more powerful options are available for migrating content via the Migrate module (&nbsp;<a href="http://drupal.org/project/migrate/" title="Drupal: migrate module">http://drupal.org/project/migrate/</a> ). &nbsp;Whereas the Feeds module proved sufficient and highly effective in moving all&nbsp;<em>Ariadne</em> content into the new Drupal platform, in cases where content to be migrated is highly dynamic or huge, then the Migrate module could be a more suitable solution as this module includes sophisticated features such as database-to-database mappings, incremental migrations, and roll-backs (with operations executable via 'drush' command-line).&nbsp;</li><li><a name="14"></a>As cited in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue68/editorial1">editorial introduction to Issue 68</a>,&nbsp;former&nbsp;<em>Ariadne</em>&nbsp;editor John Kirriemir particularly welcomes the fact that after migration to the new platform "the magazine has one universal style throughout". &nbsp;Whereas the previous 'hand-coded' production style of <em>Ariadne</em> meant that it would have been very challenging to effect a universal change in presentation style, adjustments in 'look and feel' were trivial once the content had migrated into Drupal: simply by changing theme templates (easily done via the standard Drupal configuration options) or by tweaking CSS files, the display of all content can be transformed. &nbsp;</li><li><a name="15"></a>It's noteworthy that parts of 'contrib' module Content Construction Kit (CCK) have been moved into 'core' as of Drupal version 7. &nbsp;In practice, this addition of some CCK functionality to 'core' Drupal code is a sign that CCK functionality has been accepted as essential to every site: by enabling site administrators to extend the range of Drupal database fields, &nbsp;CCK does further extend the flexibility of Drupal in accommodating a vast range of content management requirements. It is also worth noting, however, that only some parts of CCK have moved into 'core' as of Drupal 7: there is still a strong 'small core' movement within the Drupal community, which in principle is trying to reduce the size of 'core' modules as much as possible and (conversely) to increase the range of 'contrib' modules that can build on a very basic, abstracted functionality provided by a 'small core' set of code.&nbsp;</li><li><a name="16"></a>As noted above,&nbsp;Drupal has often been used as front-end to data-rich sites such as <a href="http://data.gov.uk">data.gov</a> and <a href="http://data.gov.uk">data.gov.uk</a>&nbsp;yet recently there seems to be an emerging trend in combining Drupal with large, sometimes highly dynamic data sets and code that produces interactive visualisations. &nbsp;For many examples of interesting work in this area, see <a href="http://developmentseed.org/projects" title="Overview of Development Seed Projects">http://developmentseed.org/projects</a>.</li><li><a name="17"></a>For an overview of LAMP stack (Linux Apache, MySQL, Perl / PHP / Python) development stack&nbsp;see:&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)" title="Wikipedia article: LAMP">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)</a> . &nbsp;Whereas the P in the LAMP acronym originally stood for Perl, it is now often interpreted as standing for PHP or (less frequently) Python as all of these scripting languages can be applied in similar ways depending upon a developer's personal coding preference.</li><li><a name="18"></a>From the relatively early case studies of Drupal published by IBM developerWorks, to the most recent work undertaken to make Drupal 7 compatible with Microsoft SQL Server, it is clear that Drupal's architecture makes it amenable to a broad range of applications buth open source and proprietary.</li><li><a name="19"></a>The relatively new Libraries API module (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/libraries/" title="Drupal: Libraries API module">http://drupal.org/project/libraries/</a>&nbsp;), for instance, positions itself as "common denominator for all Drupal modules/profiles/themes that integrate with external libraries". &nbsp;As such, this module provides a mechanism for bringing into Drupal various libraries (such as JQuery) in a uniform way, so that &nbsp;libraries can be easily upgraded without complications and&nbsp;all modules can reliably use a specified library without creating unexpected conflicts (due to multiple, incompatible versions being installed, etc).</li><li><a name="20"></a>For overviews of development work on 'Creating Beautiful Maps for Drupal with TileMill' see:&nbsp;<a href="http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/mar/08/creating-beautiful-maps-drupal-tilemill/" title="Development Seed: DrupalCon session on using TileMill and TileStream">http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/mar/08/creating-beautiful-maps-drupal-tilemill/</a>. &nbsp;For more information on the Drupal 'contrib' module in alpha stages of development for direct integration of Highcharts, see: &nbsp;<a href="http://drupal.org/project/highcharts" title="Drupal module: Highcharts">http://drupal.org/project/highcharts</a>&nbsp;. &nbsp;</li><li><a name="21"></a>For an overview of ProxySniffer 'Professional Web Load and Stress testing Tool' see:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.proxy-sniffer.com/" title="ProxySniffer website">http://www.proxy-sniffer.com/</a></li><li><a name="22"></a>For an in-depth explanation of best-practice procedures for Drupal performance optimisation and server tuning, see the 1.5 hour video recording of conference workshop presentation by Nate Haug:&nbsp;<a href="http://drupalize.me/videos/overview-performance-scalability" title="Nate Haug:  An Overview of Performance &amp; Scalability">http://drupalize.me/videos/overview-performance-scalability</a></li></ol><h2>Author Details</h2><p class="authors"><a name="author1"></a><strong>Dr. Thom Bunting</strong><br>Observatory and Innovation Zone Project Manager / Web Manager<br>Innovation Support Centre<br>UKOLN<br>University of Bath<br>Bath BA2 7AY</p><p class="authors">Email: t.bunting@ukoln.ac.uk<br>Web site: http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/ukoln/staff/t.bunting/</p><p class="right"><a href="bunting.html#top"><small>Return to top</small></a></p><p class="footer">Article Title: "Moving Ariadne: Migrating and Enriching Content with Drupal"<br>Author: Thom Bunting<br>Publication Date: 30-July-2012 Publication: Ariadne Issue 69<br>Originating URL: http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue69/bunting/</p>
