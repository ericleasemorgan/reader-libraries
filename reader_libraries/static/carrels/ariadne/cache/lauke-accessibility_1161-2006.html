        <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue46/lauke#author1">Patrick Lauke</a> gives a run-down of the free TAW3 tool to aid in accessibility testing of Web pages.
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>When it comes to assessing a Web site's accessibility, any Web designer should know by now that simply running the mark-up though an automated testing tool is not enough. Automated tools are limited, purely testing for syntax, easily ascertained "yes or no" situations and a set of (sometimes quite arbitrary) heuristics, which are often based on an interpretation of accessibility guidelines on the part of the tool's developers.</p><p>Nonetheless, automated checkers are a useful tool in the arsenal of accessibility-conscious designers, provided that their results are checked for false positives/negatives [<a href="lauke.html#1">1</a>] and backed up by the necessary manual checks, carried out by a knowledgeable human tester who is familiar with any potential access issues and how they manifest themselves in a Web site.</p><p>This article gives a quick run-down of Testo Accesibilidad Web (TAW)3 [<a href="lauke.html#2">2</a>], a free tool - developed by the Spanish <span lang="es">Fundación CTIC</span> (Centre for the Development of Information and Communication Technologies in Asturias) - to test Web pages against <acronym title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</acronym> 1.0.</p><p><acronym lang="es" title="Testo Accesibilidad Web">TAW</acronym>3 is available both as an online version (similar to other tools such as <a href="http://www.contentquality.com/">Cynthia</a> [<a href="lauke.html#3">3</a>] and <a href="http://wave.webaim.org/ ">Wave</a> [<a href="lauke.html#4">4</a>]) and as a stand-alone java application. In this article, we will concentrate on the stand-alone version, which in version 3 is now also available in English.</p><h2>Application Interface</h2><p>The interface consists of a single window, divided into three main areas:</p><div align="center"><img alt="screenshot (35KB) : Figure 1: General layout of the TAW3 interface" border="0" height="480" src="../../images/issue46-lauke/figure-1.gif" title="screenshot (35KB) : Figure 1: General layout of the TAW3 interface" width="600"><p class="caption">Figure 1: General layout of the TAW3 interface</p></div><ol><li>standard menu bar;</li><li>quick access buttons;</li><li>analyser tab, which is further broken down into: a) analysis scope, b) action buttons, c) analyser settings, d) analysis result, e) source code view.</li></ol><p>The analyser panel represents the main work area of the application. It is possible to work on any number of analyser panels within the same application window, which can act independently.</p><div align="center"><img alt="screenshot (22KB) : Figure 2: Scope section of the analyser tab, showing the different options available to spider multiple pages of a Web site" border="0" height="183" src="../../images/issue46-lauke/figure-2.gif" title="screenshot (22KB) : Figure 2: Scope section of the analyser tab, showing the different options available to spider multiple pages of a Web site" width="600"><p class="caption">Figure 2: Scope section of the analyser tab, showing the different options available to spider multiple pages of a Web site</p></div><p>In the scope section of each analyser we can choose to test a single page, or to "spider" a site by defining the types of links to follow, the depth level and the overall number of pages to test.</p><div align="center"><img alt="screenshot (51KB) : Figure 3: Summary of the analysis of a single page" border="0" height="465" src="../../images/issue46-lauke/figure-3.gif" title="screenshot (51KB) : Figure 3: Summary of the analysis of a single page" width="600"><p class="caption">Figure 3: Summary of the analysis of a single page</p></div><p>After the initial automated part of the analysis has been completed, <acronym lang="es" title="Testo Accesibilidad Web">TAW</acronym> presents us with a summary of all issues it found, as well as the number of points that require human judgement on the part of the tester.</p><div align="center"><img alt="screenshot (66KB) : Figure 4: Analyser tab showing a list of priority 1 issues found on the current page" border="0" height="465" src="../../images/issue46-lauke/figure-4.gif" title="screenshot (66KB) : Figure 4: Analyser tab showing a list of priority 1 issues found on the current page" width="600"><p class="caption">Figure 4: Analyser tab showing a list of priority 1 issues found on the current page</p></div><p>Switching to the individual "Priority 1", "Priority 2" and "Priority 3" tabs, we get a comprehensive list of all the WCAG 1.0 checkpoints. From here, we can see which particular part of the page's mark-up triggered an error or requires human review.</p><p>Right-clicking on any of the checkpoints brings up a context menu to aid the tester in assessing the related issues:</p><div align="center"><img alt="screenshot (61KB) : Figure 5: 'Techniques' context menu option for an individual checkpoint, which opens the relevant part of the WCAG 1.0 page in a Web browser" border="0" height="365" src="../../images/issue46-lauke/figure-5.gif" title="screenshot (61KB) : Figure 5: 'Techniques' context menu option for an individual checkpoint, which opens the relevant part of the WCAG 1.0 page in a Web browser" width="600"><p class="caption">Figure 5: 'Techniques' context menu option for an individual checkpoint, which opens the relevant part of the <acronym title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</acronym> 1.0 page in a Web browser</p></div><ul><li>'techniques' provides a direct link to the particular checkpoint in the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <acronym title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</acronym> 1.0 document, which gives the expanded explanation of the checkpoint itself, relevant examples, and suggested techniques that satisfy the checkpoint</li></ul><div align="center"><img alt="screenshot (61KB) : Figure 6: For 'visual checking' of the current Web page a customised version of the page is opened in a Web browser" border="0" height="465" src="../../images/issue46-lauke/figure-6.gif" title="screenshot (61KB) : Figure 6: For 'visual checking' of the current Web page a customised version of the page is opened in a Web browser" width="600"><p class="caption">Figure 6: For 'visual checking' of the current Web page a customised version of the page is opened in a Web browser</p></div><ul><li>"visual checking" creates a customised local copy of the currently analysed Web page, which adds mark-up and styling in order to visually highlight the potential issues and facilitate manual assessment. This approach of 'assisted manual testing' is similar to that of <a href="http://www.sidar.org/ex_hera/">HERA</a> [<a href="lauke.html#5">5</a>], a Web-based tool produced by the Spanish <span lang="es">Fundación Sidar</span>.</li></ul><p>Of course, this step can be further complemented by additional manual checking methodologies, such as those outlined in my <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue/issue44/lauke/">previous article</a> on "<cite>Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility with Firefox</cite>" [<a href="lauke.html#6">6</a>]</p><div align="center"><img alt="screenshot (66KB) : Figure 7: Validity level context menu for an individual checkpoint" border="0" height="465" src="../../images/issue46-lauke/figure-7.gif" title="screenshot (66KB) : Figure 7: Validity level context menu for an individual checkpoint" width="600"><p class="caption">Figure 7: 'Validity level' context menu for an individual checkpoint</p></div><ul><li>once the tester has carried out the manual check, the result can be recorded via the 'validity level' sub-menu; the checkpoint can be marked as a clear pass or fail, as well as 'not tested', 'cannot tell' and 'not applicable'.</li></ul><div align="center"><img alt="screenshot (55KB) : Figure 8: Checkpoint annotation dialog window" border="0" height="402" src="../../images/issue46-lauke/figure-8.gif" title="screenshot (55KB) : Figure 8: Checkpoint annotation dialog window" width="600"><p class="caption">Figure 8: Checkpoint annotation dialog window</p></div><p>Where necessary, it is possible to make specific annotations for each checkpoint tested (for instance, to back up a particular validity level that was chosen). So, for a comprehensive test, we work through each of the checkpoints, ensuring that all automated checks have yielded the correct result and assigning a validity level to all of the human checks.</p><div align="center"><img alt="screenshot (21KB) : Figure 9: Checkpoints checklist dialog window" border="0" height="550" src="../../images/issue46-lauke/figure-9.gif" title="screenshot (21KB) : Figure 9: Checkpoints checklist dialog window" width="600"><p class="caption">Figure 9: Checkpoints checklist dialog window</p></div><p>At any point, we can get a slightly more compact checklist for the current analyser via the <cite>Checkpoint › Checklist</cite> menu option.</p><div align="center"><img alt="screenshot (9KB) : Figure 10: An HTML Guidelines settings dialog, with two priority 3 'until user agents' checkpoints unchecked" border="0" height="312" src="../../images/issue46-lauke/figure-10.gif" title="screenshot (9KB) : Figure 10: An HTML Guidelines settings dialog, with two priority 3 'until user agents' checkpoints unchecked" width="455"><p class="caption">Figure 10: An <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> Guidelines settings dialog, with two priority 3 'until user agents' checkpoints unchecked.</p></div><p>An interesting feature of <acronym lang="es" title="Testo Accesibilidad Web">TAW</acronym> is the ability to create sub-sets of <acronym title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</acronym> 1.0 to test against. From the "Guidelines settings" dialog we can choose not only which level of compliance we're assessing (single A, double A, triple A), but also exclude specific checkpoints. For instance, if we make a conscious judgement that the priority 3 checkpoint 10.4 'Until user agents handle empty controls correctly, include default, place-holding characters in edit boxes and text areas' is not relevant any more (i.e. that the 'until user agents' clause has been satisfied for all user agents in common use today), we can explicitly omit this point from our testing regime.</p><div align="center"><img alt="screenshot (51KB) : Figure 11: User check dialog and the associated regular expression attribute wizard" border="0" height="609" src="../../images/issue46-lauke/figure-11.gif" title="screenshot (51KB) : Figure 11: User check dialog and the associated regular expression attribute wizard" width="600"><p class="caption">Figure 11: User check dialog and the associated regular expression attribute wizard</p></div><p>Although very limited in scope (particularly due to a bug, <a href="lauke.html#TAW3bug">see below</a>), <acronym lang="es" title="Testo Accesibilidad Web">TAW</acronym> also allows us to define additional checks via the User checkings' dialog. Currently, we are only able to select the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> element the check applies to and (through a regular or wizard-based dialog) define which attribute this element is either required or not allowed to have in order to pass the check. For instance, we could create a rule to ensure that all&nbsp;BLOCKQUOTE elements found in a page also have a&nbsp;CITE attribute.</p><div align="center"><img alt="screenshot (45KB) : Figure 12: An HTML 'TAW report' opened in a Web browser" border="0" height="465" src="../../images/issue46-lauke/figure-12.gif" title="screenshot (45KB) : Figure 12: An HTML 'TAW report' opened in a Web browser" width="600"><p class="caption">Figure 12: An <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> '<acronym lang="es" title="Testo Accesibilidad Web">TAW</acronym> report' opened in a Web browser</p></div><p>Once we are finished with the overall test, we can save our results in three different ways: as an HTML summary (which simply presents the frequency of errors encountered in tabular format), as an HTML "TAW report" (which adds markers and error descriptions to the analysed page, in the same way as TAW's online version) and as an Evaluation and Report Language (EARL) [<a href="lauke.html#7">7</a>] file (a recent XML format which was specifically created with this type of application in mind).</p><div align="center"><img alt="screenshot (35KB) : Figure 13: An EARL report opened in Notepad" border="0" height="300" src="../../images/issue46-lauke/figure-13.gif" title="screenshot (35KB) : Figure 13: An EARL report opened in Notepad" width="600"><p class="caption">Figure 13: An <acronym title="Evaluation and Report Language">EARL</acronym> report opened in Notepad</p></div><h2>Problems and Bugs</h2><p>The main problem with <acronym lang="es" title="Testo Accesibilidad Web">TAW</acronym> lies with its interface. Currently, there seems to be a large amount of unnecessary redundancy: in most cases, the same functions can be accessed via a button, menu option and context menu. This is not a bad thing in itself, but becomes confusing when it's not carried through consistently. For instance, the checkpoint checklist dialog provides buttons for "Visual checking" and "Checkpoint annotations", but does not offer the tester any way to set the checkpoints' validity levels.</p><p>The order in which some steps need to be carried out also matters, but no indication is given via the interface. For instance, "Reports" and "Guidelines" settings need to be chosen before an analysis is started. Changing the settings in an existing analyser pane has no effect, even after hitting the "refresh" button.</p><p>Some of the errors reported by the automated test are contentious and based on an interpretation of the relevant <acronym title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</acronym> checkpoint. For example, the tool fails priority 2 checkpoint 3.5 "Use header elements to convey document structure and use them according to specification" if, for whatever reason, header levels "jump" by more than one level (e.g. having an</p>
<pre>H3</pre>
<p>immediately follow an</p>
<pre>H1</pre>
<p>, completely skipping</p>
<pre>H2</pre>
<p>) - neither <acronym title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</acronym> nor the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> specification explicitly forbid this (although it's admittedly not the best of practices).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div align="center"><img alt="screenshot (61KB) : Figure 14: Analyser summary of spidering multiple pages within a Web site" border="0" height="465" src="../../images/issue46-lauke/figure-14.gif" title="screenshot (61KB) : Figure 14: Analyser summary of spidering multiple pages within a Web site" width="600"><p class="caption">Figure 14: Analyser summary of spidering multiple pages within a Web site</p></div><p>Although the tool allows for the "spidering" of an entire site, if the same issue appears on multiple pages (which can happen, particularly if a site is based on a common template), it is not possible currently to review the issue only once and then set the validity level across all tested pages. This makes using the tool for more than one page at a time quite a tedious experience.</p><p>Guideline settings, and even the entire current <acronym lang="es" title="Testo Accesibilidad Web">TAW</acronym> project, can be saved for future use, but surprisingly the developers opted for a proprietary file format. Personally, I would have welcomed the use of some flavour of <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>, which would have opened up these files for potential reuse and manipulation outside of the <acronym lang="es" title="Testo Accesibilidad Web">TAW</acronym> application itself.</p><div align="center"><img alt="screenshot (54KB) : Figure 15: Application bug: the context menu for user-defined checkpoints does not allow you to set the validity level" border="0" height="465" src="../../images/issue46-lauke/figure-15.gif" title="screenshot (54KB) : Figure 15: Application bug: the context menu for user-defined checkpoints does not allow you to set the validity level" width="600"><p class="caption">Figure 15: Application bug: the context menu for user-defined checkpoints does not allow you to set the validity level</p></div><p><a name="TAW3bug"></a>Lastly, what I can only assume is a bug in the program: although it is possible to create user-defined checks, the tool does not allow the tester to set the validity level - the option is simply greyed out. This renders the whole concept of user checks fairly pointless for anything other than purely automated types of checks where the validity can be determined, without margin for error or human judgement, by the software.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p><acronym lang="es" title="Testo Accesibilidad Web">TAW</acronym>3 is certainly not as powerful and comprehensive as some of the commercial, enterprise level testing packages (such as the accessibility module of <a href="http://www.watchfire.com/products/webxm/">Watchfire WebXM</a> [<a href="lauke.html#8">8</a>]). In its current implementation, the application has a few bugs and an overall clumsy interface, which make it look unnecessarily complicated and confusing at first glance.</p><p>However, the strong emphasis on human checking and some of the advanced features (like the capability to export an <acronym title="Evaluation and Report Language">EARL</acronym> report, to test only against a sub-set of <acronym title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</acronym> 1.0, and to create user-defined checks) make this a very interesting free tool for small-scale testing.</p><h2>References</h2><ol><li><a name="1"></a>Davies, M.
