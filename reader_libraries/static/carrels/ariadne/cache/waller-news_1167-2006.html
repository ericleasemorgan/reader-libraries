There are many software tools which can support them, from shared workspaces to resource planning and reporting tools, from electronic meetings to web content management. But which tools are effective for EU research projects? Management tools for coordinating a construction project are rarely suitable for the more uncertain world of research.</p><p>At this seminar, project coordinators and participants in EU research projects will explain how they use these tools for a range of functions and what gave their consortia the greatest benefits. Topics will include:</p><ul><li>Web-based project planning, monitoring and reporting</li><li>Web-based project management</li><li>Shared workspaces and other collaboration tools</li><li>Web tools for dissemination and building research communities and ideas will be shared on</li><li>Communicating between partners</li><li>Finding the current version of a document</li><li>Persuading partners to report on time</li><li>Getting all partners to use the same document format</li><li>Coping with one international meeting after another</li></ul><p>For more information: <a href="http://www.singleimage.co.uk/Workshops/schedule.html">http://www.singleimage.co.uk/Workshops/schedule.html</a></p><p align="right"><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><!-- <a name="events2"></a><h3>An Introduction to Creative Commons Licences</h3> <p>The Association for Information Management, London - Tuesday 14 February 2006 <a href="http://www.aslib.co.uk/training/4/25.html">http://www.aslib.co.uk/training/4/25.html</a></p> <p>This half-day workshop, hosted by the Association for Information Management, is a basic introduction to Creative Commons and its implications for the information professional.

Randy Metcalfe of OSS Watch will be joining Marieke Guy of UKOLN to lead the discussions.</p> <p>Alternative dates for this event include:<br /> * 15 September 2006<br /> * 12 October 2006</p> <p align="right"><small><a href="#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p> <hr /> --><p><a name="events3"></a></p><h3>Code4lib 2006 Conference</h3><p>15-17 February 2006<br>Corvallis, Oregon, USA<br>Registration still possible</p><p>Registration is still possible for Code4lib 2006.

The workshop will seek to development a framework which will aim to ensure that potentially disruptive technologies can successfully be absorbed into production services.</p><p>Further information, including online booking, is available at:<br><a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/ucisa-ukoln-cetis-2006/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/ucisa-ukoln-cetis-2006/</a></p><p align="right"><br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events6"></a></p><h3>JISC Conference 2006</h3><p>International Convention Centre, Birmingham - Tuesday 14 March 2006<br><a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=conf06_home">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=conf06_home</a></p><p>This year's JISC Conference programme will be built on the theme of Supporting Education and Research.

Statistics released today from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy show that in 2004/05 visits to public libraries increased by over three million. There were over 17 million more visits to libraries in 2004/05 than there were in 2001/02.</p><p>The figures, which represent the most accurate information available on public library usage, show that 42% of library services are achieving seven or more of the ten Public Library Service Standards. At the same time they challenge libraries to improve, showing that the number of active borrowers and the number of issues continue to fall.</p><p>Commenting on the findings, Head of Library Policy at the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA), John Dolan said: "These figures are a welcome spotlight on library performance and their timely release means that public libraries services can start the year knowing that more people are visiting and also with a clear set of goals for the future.</p><p>"The impact of the People's Network shows that investing in a new means of accessing information and learning was a wise move. At the same time it will always be a priority for libraries to focus on books and reading, and MLA is working with other organisations including The Reading Agency and publishers to implement best practice in this area."</p><p>Meanwhile MLA is working with a broad range of stakeholders to develop options for new models of <a href="newsline.html#news3">stock procurement</a>.

Both parties have signed up to a three-year programme of collaboration which will open up greater opportunities for staff in terms of career progression and development.</p><p>At the heart of the partnership is the development of a variety of routes into working in libraries and archives, offering greater access to training and more flexibility in planning career pathways. Other key strands of development include the collection of more robust workforce data, enhancing leadership skills and increasing diversity in the sector's workforce.</p><p>Welcoming the new partnership, David Hunter, Chief Executive of LLUK said that in a knowledge-driven economy, libraries and archives staff had a vital role to play. MLA Chief Executive Chris Batt announced his enthusiasm for the partnership and identified the ultimate goals of improving public access to collections and resources in libraries and archives, and developing a diverse and knowledgeable workforce. Speaking from an employer perspective David Ruse, Director of Libraries at the Westminster City Council, said that libraries and archives play a vital role in enabling communities and small businesses to access lifelong learning opportunities.</p><p>Source: MLA</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: December 2005 </em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news6"></a></p><h3>JORUM user service now available</h3><p>The JORUM Team is pleased to announce that Further and Higher Education institutions in the UK can now register for the JORUM User Service.</p><p>JORUM User allows staff from registered institutions to search, browse, preview, download, review, reuse and repurpose resources in JORUM. This free online repository service hosts a range of learning and teaching resources, covering a variety of subject areas and educational levels.</p><p>JISC views JORUM as a long-term venture and as the service develops, the type, breadth and subject coverage of resources available in JORUM will depend on contributions made by the community. JORUM's success will be built on the support surrounding the service by the team, the long-term view taken by JISC and the commitment and enthusiasm of both Contributors and Users.</p><p>Institutions must register first before staff are able to gain access.

A Site Rep and a Technical Rep must also be nominated, providing a local point of contact for staff within the institution and for the JORUM Team.</p><p>The JORUM Contributor Service, allowing institutions and projects to donate resources to JORUM, was launched in November 2005. Since then an initial collection of resources has been submitted, from over 20 institutions which have signed up. The current collection reflects the projects and institutions which have contributed material so far, there are a number of sizeable collections including engineering and ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Language).</p><p>The newly updated JORUM Web site (<a href="http://www.jorum.ac.uk/"> http://www.jorum.ac.uk/ </a>) has a comprehensive new section on JORUM User (<a href="http://www.jorum.ac.uk/user/"> http://www.jorum.ac.uk/user/ </a>) offering support in registering and logging in, as well as a useful selection of support, training and promotional materials.</p><p>Contact:<br>Jackie Carter<br><a href="mailto:support@jorum.ac.uk">support@jorum.ac.uk</a></p><p align="right">[<em>Received: January 2006</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news7"></a></p><h3>Orphan Works Report from US Copyright Office is now available</h3><p>The US Copyright Office has submitted its report on orphan works.
