During 2003-2004, with the help of a grant from the MLA Designation Challenge Fund, the Museum was able successfully to re-house and digitise this internationally important collection and make the results available on a new Web site:<br>(<a href="http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/ceramics/">http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/ceramics/</a>).</p><p>The collection can now be viewed in custom-built storage cabinets with clear fronts to allow good visibility, with some items in drawers and larger items in open storage. An information zone provides online access to the catalogue as well as literature relevant to the collection. The collection is available to researchers by appointment.</p><p>Information on other ceramics and glass collections held by non-national museums in the London area will be added to the Web site in November, following a recent survey.</p><p>To mark the end of this important project, the Museum of London invite you to a seminar at Mortimer Wheeler House on Thursday 18 November, 2004 (11am - 5pm). Here, delegates will have a chance to view the new storage facilities, hear about the collections, their move to the new store as well as the digitisation process and Web site.</p><p>Supported by the MLA Designation Challenge Fund, the day will be <strong>free</strong> to all delegates.

Understanding and trusting recommender systems<br>Do users understand and trust the recommendations they receive from recommender systems, what kinds of information do recommenders need to provide to users to build trust, and how difficult is it to regain trust in a recommender if it is lost?</p><p>2. User interfaces for recommender systems<br>What are good ways to present recommendations to users, how do you integrate recommenders into the displays of existing information systems, and how can interfaces encourage users to provide ratings in order to 'close the loop' for recommendations, that is, how can you get users to consume the items recommended and then tell the system how good the recommendations are?</p><p>3. The future of recommendation algorithms and their metrics<br>How can we generate better individual and group recommendations, develop new metrics and evaluation criteria for recommendations, and achieve cross-domain recommendations?</p><p>4. Social consequences and opportunities of recommender systems<br>How do individuals and groups of people respond to recommendations, how can recommendations be integrated with online and real world communities, and in what ways do recommendations affect social organisations?</p><h3>Intended Audience</h3><p>The workshop is intended for both established researchers and practioners in the domain of recommender systems as well as for new researchers and students with interesting ideas on recommender systems and their future. Participants do not have to come from a specific application domain, as long as their research or ideas are on one of the main topics of the workshop.</p><h3>Important Dates</h3><p>8 Nov 2004: Paper Submission Deadline<br>28 Nov 2004: Paper Acceptance Notification<br>6 Dec 2004: Camera-ready Copies Due (and last day of Early Registration for IUI 2005)<br>10 Dec 2004: Papers Available from Web site<br>9 Jan 2005: Workshop at IUI 2005</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: September 2004</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><h3><a name="events7"></a>Latest News on Museums &amp; Galleries Month 2005:<br>Building on Success with Objects of Desire: The Art of Collecting</h3><p>Museums and Galleries Month will take place from 1 to 31 May 2005.&nbsp; Over a thousand museums and galleries around the UK will take part in this countrywide promotion.</p><p>Building on 2004, MGM2005 has an multi-faceted theme and a programme of national and regional events are now in the planning stage.&nbsp; Museums and galleries are also developing events and activities around the theme.

It begins by discussing the methods by which material can be licensed for distribution on the Internet, and the implications of making such material available for use online. It examines the terms and conditions that users are required to accept in using AHDS collections, and it gives a practical example of how the rights of depositors have been protected. It provides an exemplar action plan that rights managers may find useful in protecting copyrights that have been entrusted to them. It concludes by arguing that clarity over rights and responsibilities is as important in the protection of digital assets as authentication or authorisation.</p><p>This case study will be relevant to many parties, including those charged with creating digital resources, those who use digital resources, and those who publish resources through the Internet.</p><p>Alastair Dunning<br>Arts and Humanities Data Service<br>King's College London<br>0207 848 1972</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: October 2004</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news2"></a></p><h3>OpenURL Standard Adds Greater Functionality and Interoperability to Collection Manager</h3><p>Blackwell's Book Services has implemented the OpenURL standard, a protocol for linking from one information resource to another via a library link resolver, in its Collection Manager™ system.</p><p>With the OpenURL standard in place, libraries can seamlessly connect to a variety of online resources, such as WorldCat, book review databases, Blackwell's Online Bookshop, or the library's own ILL service simply by designating or identifying the libraries link resolver in their Collection Manager preferences. This allows acquisitions staff to make more informed buying and collection development decisions, easily integrated into their local acquisitions workflow at the point of order. Linking from Collection Manager to a union catalogue without a link resolver is also supported in some cases depending on the URL structure of the union catalogue.</p><p>Blackwell's joins a number of leading library suppliers in adopting the Open URL standard. Hundreds of library databases now support the OpenURL standard and more than a thousand institutions use link resolvers, greatly benefiting library staff and patrons by expanding the number of resources available to them.</p><p>Blackwell's Books Services headquarters are located in Lake Oswego, Oregon, USA with offices in Oxford, England, Sydney, Australia, and Blackwood, New Jersey, USA.</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: October 2004</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news3"></a></p><h3>Early English Books Online</h3><p>Early English Books Online, is introducing lecturers, students and researchers to the full possibilities of online resources.

It is intended to act as a point of entry to the field of IPR in e-learning that will provide a good foundation for building expertise in the e-learning developer community. It deals with the basic aspects of IPR, especially copyright, in e-learning content development, with an emphasis on reusing third party materials to create new resources. The guide has been written by an e-learning content developer who has had to deal with these issues in practice. The style of the guide is practical and approachable with many useful tips and observations but it also provides a sketch of the wider issues. It also provides flow diagrams, templates, case studies and further sources of information and guidance</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: October 2004</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news5"></a></p><h3>JISC and The Academic Library announce changes to their agreement for The Academic Library's ebooks collections.</h3><p><strong>New Collections</strong><br>Institutions can now subscribe to titles from the United Nations University Press via The Academic Library.

A further £250,000 was allocated to the West Midlands Local Government Association (WMLGA) from the European Regional Development Fund's (ERDF) Innovative Actions campaign, administered by the Regional Development Agency. This means there will be no subscription or technical cost to local authorities.</p><h3><a name="collabtools"></a>Technical Details</h3><p>KEN includes a suite of Web-based collaboration tools from Lotus - Sametime and Quickplace - to create virtual meeting places for up to 16,000 people simultaneously. These include structured instant discussion facilities, online whiteboards and document sharing workspaces. Any collaboration within the spaces is automatically minuted for immediate download and can then be indexed and archived. This reduces unnecessary administration and makes it easier for local authority colleagues across the region to benefit from others' experiences and creativity - without the time and cost of travel.</p><p>A fully searchable regional knowledge base includes automatic document harvesting and an intelligent regional search engine. Authorities decide which documents they wish to include in KEN and the software retrieves, indexes and archives them automatically.</p><p>Searching for 'smartcard', for example, would automatically also retrieve documents containing the words 'identity card'. This could give officers information and case studies on local smartcard schemes, proposed uses or cost models. The search element is powered by Fretwell-Downing Informatics (FDI), the founding technology partner for the seamlessUK citizens' information portal.</p><h3>Demo disk</h3><p>A KEN demo disk is available on request from <a href="mailto:p.kendal@smartregion.org.uk">p.kendal@smartregion.org.uk</a> or 0121 245 0190.</p><h3>Conference and KEN 'go live' date</h3><p>KEN will go live at the 'Governance Partnership in the West Midlands' conference on 12 November in Birmingham. This event includes speakers from ODPM and West Midlands in Europe and showcases regional 'e' collaboration and smart-working programmes from local authorities across the region. For more details or to book your place contact: email: <a href="mailto:p.kendal@smartregion.org.uk">p.kendal@smartregion.org.uk</a>, ring 0121 245 0190 or book online at <a href="http://www.askken.org.uk/conferenceRegistration.asp">http://www.askken.org.uk/conferenceRegistration.asp</a>.

While the ICT skills training given to all public library staff has enabled them to manage the technology and help new users, setting up the PCs to support streaming media effectively has caused some headaches.</p><p>Enter a new online support resource just launched by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) designed to help those library staff check out their computers and set them up to give the best access to streamed media. Developed by streaming media specialists Groovy Gecko, the diagnostic toolkit provides information about two popular software products used to view Web broadcasts and will provide information to MLA, who continue to manage the development of the People's Network, on the use of streaming media in public libraries.</p><p>Commenting on the launch Chris Batt, Chief Executive of MLA said that, "Library staff have completed the installation of the People's Network infrastructure on time and in budget, and all library staff have now been trained in IT skills. The third phase of the project is the delivery of e-services to communities throughout the country, using the People's Network.. This online diagnostic tool will help MLA and libraries to plan more effectively in delivering exciting, cutting edge e-services which employ the use of audio and video."</p><p>The tool and instructions to use it can be found at: <a href="http://www.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk/future/streaming.asp">http://www.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk/future/streaming.asp</a></p><p align="right">[<em>Received: September 2004</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news10"></a></p><h3>Curriculum Online - Getting your cultural content online</h3><p>For the past 18 months MLA has been working with the DfES Curriculum Online Team to promote and facilitate the provision of curriculum based e-learning materials by the cultural sector, with the following aims:</p><ul><li>To increase the use of educational content, both classroom and teacher-support resources, from the cultural sector by schools.</li><li>To improve the quality and usefulness of educational content from the cultural sector.</li><li>To make it easier for teachers, pupils and parents to discover educational content from the cultural sector that is relevant to specific curriculum learning objectives."</li></ul><p>Run by the DfES, Curriculum Online (www.curriculumonline.gov.uk <a href="http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/">http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/</a>) is an online catalogue which gives teachers easy access to a wide range of multimedia teaching and learning resources, all linked to the curriculum in England. It is a key part of the Government's drive to increase the use of ICT in the classroom.</p><p>A pilot study was launched to understand the issues cultural organisations face in becoming registered suppliers. Four organisations were selected to take part. The findings of this pilot study were presented at a series of Roadshows that took place earlier in the year, hosted by each of MLA's Regional Agencies.</p><p>Based on these findings, the DfES has published two guides which tell you the benefits of becoming a supplier to Curriculum Online, and how to do it.</p><p><strong>Guide One: Getting involved in Curriculum Online</strong> - practical steps for cultural organisations What cultural organisations can gain by becoming a Registered Supplier - An in-depth look at the administrative and practical issues involved. Includes funding, registering, how to measure success, and useful sources of information.</p><p><strong>Guide Two: Preparing your content for Curriculum Online</strong> - a guide for cultural organisations A practical guide to reviewing, adapting and creating content for Curriculum Online. Full of useful hints and tips to maximise the potential of your content as digital learning resources.</p><p>These two guides are now available at <a href="http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/culture ">http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/culture </a> - The area of the Curriculum Online Web site specially designed for cultural organisations. As well as everything you need to know about becoming, or being, a supplier, you'll find information about the Pilot Study, key learning points from this research, and the Roadshows where these findings were presented as well as the following key documents:</p><ul><li>Getting Involved in Curriculum Online: practical steps for cultural organisations</li><li>Preparing your content for Curriculum Online: a guide for cultural organisations</li><li>The Curriculum Online Tagging Tool</li><li>A presentation by MLA on the learnings from the Pilot Study</li><li>A presentation by the DfES on the role of ICT in schools</li><li>eLearning case studies from the Regional Agencies</li><li>ICT in action - DfES video case studies</li></ul><p>This gives an excellent overview for those unable to attend the Roadshows,. If you did attend, we hope you'll find these resources a useful presentation tool to help you spread the word to other colleagues. (These resources are also available in limited quantities on CD for those unable to download them from the Web site.</p><p>Please contact your local MLA Regional Agency for details <a href="http://www.mla.gov.uk/action/regional/regionsmap.asp">http://www.mla.gov.uk/action/regional/regionsmap.asp</a></p><p align="right">[<em>Received: October 2004</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news11"></a></p><h3>URCHIN</h3><p>Nature Publishing Group (NPG) are pleased to announce the lastest release of their open-source RSS aggregator 'Urchin' to SourceForge (<a href="http://urchin.sf.net">http://urchin.sf.net</a>). Initially funded by the UK Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC, <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/</a>) as one of the Publisher and Library/Learning Systems (PALS, <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=programme_pals">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=programme_pals</a>) Metadata and Interoperability Group projects, Urchin has been substantially improved. Version 0.92, the current stable release, introduces the following changes:</p><ul><li>A mod_perl front end for performance and persistence</li><li>Using XML::LibXSLT to improve performance</li><li>A new option for using HTTP status codes for error reporting</li><li>Old items can be now be expunged after an update via an administrator-defined query</li><li>Access, admin and error logs</li><li>Web-triggerable remote refresh</li><li>Configurable RDF output by adminstrator-defined inclusion or exclusion of namespaces</li><li>The ability to combine several simple RDF query conditions using boolean AND and OR</li><li>Numerous bug fixes</li></ul><p>Urchin is a Web based, customisable, RSS aggregator and filter. Its primary purpose is to allow the generation of new RSS feeds by running queries against the collection of items in the Urchin database. However, other arbitrary output formats can be defined and generated using XSL transformations or HTML::Template templates. In other words, the collection of Urchin Perl modules form a foundation for building an RSS aggregation or portal service.</p><p>Urchin is a classic LAMP implementation written in Perl using, wherever possible, pre-existing Perl modules. It uses MySQL for its database functionality and can run using either Apache with a mod_perl handler or any CGI-enabled Web server using the CGI script that is included with the distribution. While Urchin is developed on a Red Hat Linux system, it has been ported to Mac OS X, and earlier versions have run successfully under Windows 2000, XP and CygWin.</p><p>This code has been tested on Red Hat Linux 8.0 running Apache version 2.0.40, MySQL version 4.0.13 and Perl version 5.8.0, and on Mac OS X 10.3.5 running Apache version 2.0.49, MySQL version 4.0.16 and Perl version 5.8.1.</p><p>Urchin's feature set includes:</p><ul><li>Reads RSS 0.9*, 1.0 and 2.0</li><li>Stores all incoming data in RSS 0.9x and 1.0 feeds</li><li>Queryable on arbitrary data fields</li><li>Supports boolean, simple RDF, full RDF querying</li><li>Arbitrary output formats</li></ul><p>Alongside version 0.92, a development code snapshot has been released that includes support for importing Atom feeds, new administrative commands for defining feed aggregates, and the ability to use RSS and Atom auto-discovery links.</p><p>Urchin is Free Software. Portions of the code are licensed under the GNU General Public License, the rest under the GNU Lesser General Public License.</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: August 2004</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news11"></a></p><h3>RDN Welcomes New Director</h3><p>Caroline Williams recently started as the new Executive Director of the Resource Discovery Network, taking overall responsibility for the strategic development of the service.</p><p>Most recently, Caroline was with Manchester Metropolitan University Library as Manager for Electronic Services Development, leading a range of electronic projects.
