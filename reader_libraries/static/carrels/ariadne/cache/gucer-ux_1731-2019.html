<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>In March 2018, after more than two years of development, the creators
of the Animal Welfare Act History Digital Collection (AWAHDC, <A
href="gucer.html#ref4">awahistory.nal.usda.gov</a> )
were poised to launch this unique new digital library. We had
encountered and solved many problems with the workflows (as described
in <a href="gucer.html#ref2">Gucer et al. 2019</a>) throughout the process of
designing and implementing this collection in house at the National
Agricultural Library (NAL, <a
href="http://nal.usda.gov">nal.usda.gov</a>). These backend problems
had delayed the completion of our user interface until the last stages
of the project, but in the late spring of 2018 were finally ready to
go live with this interface—almost. There was one thing left to do:
conduct user testing. From the beginning of the project, we had
envisioned testing the usability of our interface before launching the
collection. But this was new territory for our development team and
for the library in general. Although NAL had created and launched
digital collections in the past, it had not conducted user testing on
these products. We had no in-house model or policy to follow and our
time was limited to a few months. Nor did we have funds in our budget
to hire a usability professional. So, when a colleague casually
mentioned Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-It-Yourself Guide to
Finding and Fixing Usability Problems by Steve Krug (<a
href="gucer.html#ref3">Krug 2009</a>), our ears perked up.</p>

<p>As the title suggests, Krug’s slim volume offers website creators a
flexible, low-cost, low-stress, time-limited method for conducting
user testing of websites. What is more, Krug’s approach to user
testing is based in Agile methodology, an approach originally
developed in the software industry. We on the AWAHDC team had already
had success in incorporating elements of the Agile approach into the
development of this digital collection, so Krug’s book was all the
more appealing for this reason. Krug’s method was attractive for two
further reasons. First, it assumes that amateurs can do user testing
that is effective and will make their websites better. While Krug
recommends hiring usability experts if funds are available, he says
that the lack of such resources should not prevent amateurs from
running their own tests. Secondly, we found that our production team
perfectly fit the creators Krug describes as benefitting most from his
method for user testing: “This book assumes that usability testing is
not your life’s work and is probably not even part of your official
job description.”  The point is to get website creators to do some
testing because so many do not (<a href="gucer.html#ref3">Krug 2009, p. 5</a>).</p>

<p>In the following case study, I describe how we adapted Krug’s method
to test the AWAHDC, how we implemented our protocol, and then reflect
on our experience. Our perspective will be of interest to librarians
and other information professionals in libraries or other nonprofit
contexts. Although Krug pitches the book at all website creators,
there is an emphasis in his examples and online materials on the
websites of small- to medium-sized companies who sell and ship
products to the public. Our experience shows how Krug’s method can be
adapted to a non-profit, library context where “users” are researchers
and students, and the “product” is public or otherwise available
information that has been brought together and curated in a digital
resource with specialized instructions, search, and faceting
functions. We sense that there is a need among these professionals for
practical, how-to information on usability testing. A cursory search
of the LIS literature suggests that little has been written on the
user testing of small subject-oriented collections, much less agile
methods in such user testing. What is more, whenever we have promoted
the AWAHDC among librarians and information professionals at other
libraries, they have been very keen to learn about our agile method
and have lamented the lack of user testing of similar products in
their organizations. This article speaks directly to readers among
these groups and offers them a model for developing their own user
tests.</p>

<p>This article is not a replacement for Krug’s book. Readers interested
in conducting usability testing on the model presented here should
obtain and read Rocket Surgery Made Easy. Krug offers many
instructions, details about, and options within, his method of user
testing that we do not cover. In fact, the method that we fashioned
from Krug’s book is a slimmer version of his already sleek model. At
times we point to these differences but we do not cover them in detail
or comprehensively. This case study shows how we used Krug’s method in
our library and presents some highlights from our results as a way of
whetting librarians’ appetite for usability testing and convincing
them that it can be done. The article also reveals the significant
payoff that libraries will get from testing their digital products for
relatively little cost and effort.</p>

<h2 id="background">BACKGROUND</h2>

<p>This section describes the <a href="gucer.html#ref4">AWAHDC</a> briefly and then
summarizes how our usability tests fit into the digital production
process at NAL. It thereby situates this method in the context of
digital curation in a library. The AWAHDC is a free, full-text, and
fully searchable, collection of US government publications in PDF
documenting the legislative and regulatory history of the Animal
Welfare Act, which was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson in
1966. It was designed by the author of this article, a postdoctoral
fellow in digital curation at the University of Maryland, and the
director of the Animal Welfare Information Center (AWIC), which
sponsors the AWAHDC and is based at the library. The AWAHDC is a key
tool in fulfilling an important mission of the center to inform the
members of the community regulated by the Animal Welfare Act,
including research scientists and breeders, as well as the general
public, about the intent and history of the act. Together, the
director and I organized a team of librarians, cataloguers, web
developers, and programmers at the library and oversaw the production
of the collection from 2015 through to 2018. The user testing we
describe here took place at the end of this this process, beginning in
March 2018, once we had produced a working beta version of the
collection’s interface (<a href="gucer.html#fig2">Figure 2</a>), which is built
in the open source content management system, Drupal (<a
href="http://drupal.org">drupal.org</a>).</p>

<p>At the outset, we imagined that our collection would contain 900
publications, but we quickly decided to scale back that number to
200. For various reasons that are outside the scope of this article,
we realized that we would need to streamline the collection in order
to push it through the digitization pipeline at the library in stages
rather than all at once. This turned out to be a good decision in
several ways. For one thing, it led us to investigate Agile
methodology (<a href="gucer.html#ref1">Beck et al. (n.d.)</a>) and incorporate
its principles—which emphasize a “lean” mentality, responsive
teamwork, and a flexible iterative approach to project management—into
our production plan. The first round of production resulted in a beta
version that we soft-launched in August 2018 and that was the result
of the user testing that we describe below. As this schedule suggests,
and as Krug points out (<a href="gucer.html#ref3">Krug 2009, pp. 30-37</a>),
organizations do not have to wait for a fully finished, or even
largely finished, product to begin user testing. We began testing the
AWADHC, when the frontend user-facing interface was basically usable
and we felt that we it could benefit from usability testing. In this
way, we folded usability testing into the digital production process
at its last stage.</p>

<h2 id="test-design">TEST DESIGN</h2>

<p>Our testing protocol consisted of three rounds conducted with nine
participants at one-month intervals across three consecutive months,
as described by Krug (<a href="gucer.html#ref3">Krug 2009, pp. 22-29<a/>). In
each round, three participants took the same test one after another in
one morning, with 15-minute intervals between each session. Each
session lasted no more than one hour. The sessions were conducted
one-on-one with the participant and the author, and with one silent
observer (AWIC’s director).</p>

<p>I was seated slightly to the side and behind the participant so that I
could view the screen. The silent observer was seated well behind the
participant and the author. She had her own monitor, on which she
observed the participant’s screen using screen-sharing software (we
used Webex but Skype is also an option), and a notebook in which she
kept notes. These interviews were recorded using screen and audio
capture software&ndash;in our case Camtasia (<a
href="http://techsmith.com/video-editor.html">techsmith.com/video-editor.html</a>).</p>

<p>After all interviews in each round were complete, the director and I
discussed what we had learned from these interactions, what were the
most significant problems, and how to go about fixing them before the
next round of user testing. From beginning to end, each round took
between five and six hours. The sessions were highly structured. I
read from a script from the beginning to the end of each session,
encouraging the participant to vocalize their experience and, when
necessary, keeping them on task. A sample test script is provided in
Krug’s book and we largely adopted it. While reading out loud can feel
artificial, this protocol ensures that the test will be uniformly
conducted and that all questions and issues will be covered.</p>

<p>The core of the test was four tasks that the participant was to
perform using the AWAHDC, without any help from external websites (see
an example in <a href="gucer.html#fig1">Figure 1</a>) or from us. After a
participant received a task, we asked them to talk through their
process of performing the task as they completed it. This verbal
description of their experience was, by far, the most important aspect
of the test, not whether a participant completed the task
successfully. As Krug repeatedly points out, the participant’s
immediate and authentic experience of the website provides the most
revealing and useful information for its designers. Of course, it
feels good for all when a participant completes a task. But the point
of user testing is to find and fix problems with the site. So the more
the participant talks through their moment-to-moment exploration of
and reactions to the site, the more information the designers
gain. Failure or partial success, if it involves a lot of interaction
and feedback is far more informative than easy, immediate success. As
the above description suggests, the goal of each round is to identify
basic problems with the site so that we could fix them before the next
round of testing. “Working software,” as the Agile Manifesto puts it,
“is the primary measure of progress” (<a href="gucer.html#ref1">Beck et
al.</a>), not a perfect or even completely finished product.</p>

</a></p>

<h2 id="results">RESULTS</h2>

<p>In this section I highlight two results of our usability test that
illuminate its impact on our collection. Drawing these highlights from
rounds one and three, I focus on a major payoff from each round that
significantly improved the AWAHDC.</p>

<h3 id="round-one">Round One</h3>

<p>The first round of usability testing had the biggest impact on the
AWAHDC because all three of our participants had the same immediate
response to the homepage: they were confused about the website’s
identity and purpose. This confusion arose at the very beginning of
the session, before we even got to the four main tasks. We asked the
participants to look at the homepage and, without clicking on
anything, describe what they saw. In response, all three expressed the
same confusion arising from an unintended contradiction on this
page. Specifically, the words identifying the site — that is, &ldquo;The
Animal Welfare Act History Digital Collection&rdquo; — were in the largest
font on the page and were located in the right section of a horizontal
banner across the upper part of the screen, where the Google-type
search bar was also located. But the majority of the page was taken up
by an interactive timeline that drew users’ attention to a large
colorful image of animals in the center of the page and an
accompanying description of the timeline’s function. The timeline
prompted users to click on white arrows to the right of the screen
that led them through a series of ten panels, with engaging images and
information on the act.</p>

<p><a name="fig2"></a><a target="_blank" href="../../images/issue78-gucer/roundOneHomepage.png">
    <figure style="text-align: center">
            <img alt="Sample Task" src="../../images/issue78-gucer/roundOneHomepage.png" width="80%">
                <figcaption>Figure 2: Home Page of the AWAHDC in Round One</figcaption>
    </figure>
</a></p>

<p>The participants in this first round were all so drawn to this
timeline that they did not explore the rest of the page. Or, when they
did, they expressed confusion about the site. “Is this website a
timeline, an exhibit, or is it a digital library?” was a common
response. This confusion carried over into the rest of the session, as
participants repeatedly returned to the timeline looking for answers
it could not provide. There was, we realized, an unintended mixed
message embedded in the homepage that could prevent our users from
understanding what the AWAHDC was, what it was for, and from
discovering its full functionality</p>

<h3 id="payoff-usability-testing-reveals-what-s-hidden-in-plain-sight">Payoff: Usability Testing Reveals What’s Hidden in Plain Sight</h3>

<p>User testing allows website creators to see aspects of their site to
which they have become blind. To our participants the mixed message in
the design of the homepage was as plain as day, but after months of
rethinking and tweaking the site, we had become inured to its most
obvious flaw. Early on we had discussed the possibility that the
timeline would draw users away from the site’s main functionality: the
search, retrieval, and organization of documents in the
collection. But we had balanced this concern against a desire to
inform general users up front about the act and its history in a
visually engaging form. This first round of testing brought us back to
our senses and told us to keep it simple. In the month before the next
round of user testing, we worked with the web developer on our team to
redesign the home page so that it emphasized the site’s main purpose
and functionality. The revised homepage (<a href="gucer.html#fig3">Figure 3</a>)
removed the timeline from the homepage to another page. The search bar
was now squarely in the center of the page next to the image of the
animals. Underneath the search bar we added a call to action, alerting
users to the timeline for general users: &ldquo;Not sure where to start?
Take a look at our Interactive Timeline!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="fig3"></a><a target="_blank" href="../../images/issue78-gucer/revisedHomepage.png">

                <figcaption>Figure 3: Revised Homepage of the AWAHDC for Round Two</figcaption>
    </figure>
</a></p>

<h3 id="round-three">Round Three</h3>

<p>Round Three in our user testing illuminated the solution to a problem
we had become aware of throughout the first two rounds of testing but
for which we had no single clear solution. Specifically, in order to
use the AWAHDC effectively, users need to have a basic understanding
of the two processes by which US laws are enacted in United States
Congress and subsequently enforced in the executive agencies: the
legislative and regulatory processes respectively. We therefore
created an infographic informing readers about these processes and how
they relate to the documents in the AWAHDC. This infographic appears
on the &ldquo;How to Use&rdquo; page on our site. Users can access the page using
the &ldquo;How to Use&rdquo; link in the main menu on the homepage (<a
href="gucer.html#fig4">Figure 4</a>):</p>

<p><a name="fig4"></a><a target="_blank" href="../../images/issue78-gucer/mainMenu.png">
    <figure style="text-align: center">
            <img alt="Sample Task" src="../../images/issue78-gucer/mainMenu.png" width="80%">
                <figcaption>Figure 4: Main menu on the AWAHDC’s home page</figcaption>
    </figure>
</a></p>

<p>Our problem was how to ensure that our users clicked on this link and
encountered this infographic in time for it to guide their
searches. Without this information, their experience of the site would
be diminished and they might not understand the AWAHDC’s full
significance and utility. They might even leave the site frustrated
and disinclined to return. We therefore designed one of our tasks so
that participants would, we hoped, encounter this page and use its
information in the retrieval of a specific piece of information. In
practice, however, the paths our participants took in solving this
task did not take them to this &ldquo;How to Use&rdquo; link or the related
page. The result was that, if they found the piece of information
required by the task (i.e., the title of a government serial,
Congressional Record), they used other routes to get there.</p>

<h3 id="payoff-usability-testing-reveals-solutions-not-just-problems">Payoff: Usability Testing Reveals Solutions, Not Just Problems</h3>

<p>Ironically, these repeated failures eventually offered us a solution
to our problem. As our participants increasingly found their way to
the &ldquo;Congressional Record&rdquo; by way of alternate paths than the one we
had imagined, it dawned on us that we could create multiple routes to
the page we wanted them to find and accentuate those paths. This
realization resulted in some very simple changes to the existing site,
including adding a link to the words “legislative and regulatory
documents” in the description of the collection at the center of the
homepage. We knew from earlier rounds of testing that this text’s
central position next to the eye-catching image of the animals on the
home page immediately drew users’ attention in ways that the “How To
Use” link in the menu bar did not. This experience illuminated a
wiser, more flexible perspective on the elements (e.g., text, images,
white space, organizational features) within our site—that is, as
potential pathways within a virtual space whose constituent parts were
separate but nonetheless interconnected and navigable. In this and
other ways, conducting our own usability testing increased our
expertise in our own site, and in the development of good sites more
broadly.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>Given the enormous advantage of conducting usability testing, it is
surprising how little of it gets done in libraries that sponsor
digital collections. This situation may be based in the belief that
such testing has to be a ‘big deal’ - expensive, labor-intensive, and
time-consuming - and that it will distract from the development
process. Our experience shows that such a belief is mistaken. Indeed
it also shows that Krug’s low-cost, flexible method of DIY usability
testing can prevent huge expenditures of time and money by incorporating
the learning gleaned from these tests into the development process. In
our model, there is no distinction between the usability expert and
development team, which prevents problems from taking root and
becoming larger and more intractable down the road. &ldquo;The funny thing
about usability testing,&rdquo; Krug says, &ldquo;is it just works&rdquo; (<a
href="gucer.html#ref3">Krug 2009, p. 15</a>). This has certainly been our
experience.</p>

<p>The author would like to thank Rachel Donahue for her invaluable
suggestion of Krug’s book.</p>
