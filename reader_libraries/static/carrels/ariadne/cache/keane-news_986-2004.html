It will be held on 10-11 May 2004 at the Austrian National Library.</p><p>File formats are a crucial layer, indeed a hinge between the bits in storage and their meaningful interpretation. The proper access to and display of content depends entirely on the ability to decipher the respective bitstream, and consequently on precise knowledge about how the information contained within is represented. Thus file formats are one of the core issues of any digital preservation approach, and file format obsolescence is a major challenge for anybody wanting to preserve digital files. The ERPANET Seminar aims at giving an overview on these issues and at offering guidance based on practical experience. Requirements and best practices for archival file formats will be discussed, and issues such as file format registries and format validation will be treated.</p><p>This training seminar is aimed at all people who are dealing with file format issues. These include practitioners in digital preservation from all kind of organisations and institutions, decision-makers and other people involved in choosing preservation file formats, and preservationists who are facing file format challenges and are looking for first-hand information and experience. In particular, people who want to exchange their experience with colleagues from all over Europe and beyond should consider attending.</p><p>We expect attendants to have basic familiarity with digital preservation and file format issues. Please see the bibliography on the seminar webpage at <a href="http://www.erpanet.org">http://www.erpanet.org</a> for some introductory reading.</p><p>[April 2004]</p><p><a name="4"></a></p><h2>The eVALUEd Conference - 16 June 2004, Birmingham, UK</h2><p>A one-day conference aimed at library practitioners, researchers and others which forms part of the HEFCE-funded eValued Project which is based at the UCE.</p><p>There will be a keynote address by Professor Charles McClure of Florida State University, who has been a consultant to the project, and a range of speakers in addressing current issues in the evaluation of Electronic Information Services (EIS) in Higher Education including:</p><ul><li>The e-metrics project</li><li>The emeasures project</li><li>selection criteria for e-resources</li><li>Performance management</li><li>ProjectCOUNTER</li><li>extending LIBQUAL+ to the digital environment</li></ul><p>The day will conclude with a panel drawn from the speakers who discuss a key topic.</p><p>Further details are available at <a href="http://www.ebase.uce.ac.uk/evalued/conference.htm">http://www.ebase.uce.ac.uk/evalued/conference.htm</a> or by contacting <a href="mailto:Sarah.McNicol@uce.ac.uk">Sarah.McNicol@uce.ac.uk</a></p><p>[February 2004]</p><p><a name="5"></a></p><h2>NISO Workshop: Metadata Practices on the Cutting Edge - 20 May, Washington</h2><p>Information professionals: Get the guidance you need on the growing variety of metadata standards and explore issues of interoperability.

The archival record is the foundation on which are built all our histories, with their many and varied voices.' </p> <p>A report from the influential government Archives Task Force (that included Liz Forgan, Professor David Cannadine, Dr Rita Gardner, CBE and Dame Stella Rimington) was published by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council on Wednesday 24 March 2004. The report, Listening to the Past, Speaking to the Future, comes at a time when unprecedented numbers of people at home and overseas are beginning to use the UK's archives for genealogy or to explore the history of their community. It highlights the importance and remarkable diversity of British archives and points to ways in which access to these resources can be developed.</p> <p>There are over 1.5 million visits a year to archives and 75% of those visitors are undertaking private or personal research. 72% of users see archives as a way of strengthening family or community identity, and there were 85 million information requests handled by the National Archives websites in 2002/2003. In the last 10 years, demand for archives has grown by over 50%. But despite this increasing popularity, the report shows that archives have not yet reached people from black and minority ethnic communities or the young to the same extent. </p> <p>Listening to the Past, Speaking to the Future demonstrates clearly the significant social, economic and learning power of archives, to engage people in study, but also in building evidence of their own histories. To spread these obvious benefits to as many as possible, the report calls for new measures to broaden access to archives for people from all walks of life. Its key recommendation is for an easily-accessible online Archives Gateway which would revolutionise access to and participation in archives. The Archives Gateway would lead people of all ages and knowledge to archival content of interest and support them in creating their own documentary records.</p> <p>Dame Stella Rimington, Member of the Archives Task Force and former Director General of the Security Service said: 'Archives show us, and future generations, how we came to be what we are as a nation, as a community or as an individual. They offer up secrets about our past and are a wonderful learning tool. The Task Force wanted to explore ways of making archives more exciting and accessible to more people. We feel that broadening access via a dynamic online gateway is clearly an important way forward.'</p> <p>Mark Wood, MLA Chair and Chair of the Archives Task Force said: 'Our report highlights the remarkable breadth and depth of the UK's archive heritage and the enormous potential it has to contribute to education, tourism and people's leisure time. Use of archives is growing rapidly, partly driven by interest in local or family history and heritage tourism. We want to assist and encourage these trends.</p> <p>'We propose an electronic Gateway to create easy online access to all the nation's archive collections, whether these are public, commercial, private or run by community groups. We want to draw all the nation's archives, big and small, into this Gateway and make these wonderful storehouses available to a wider range of users. While online services are crucial to the future of this sector, so are national programmes for modernisation, workforce development and collections care and the report spells out how much can be achieved with quite modest investment. </p> <p>'Our report offers a cost-efficient route to boosting skills, community cohesion and tourism, through a fascinating area of our heritage which still remains relatively untapped.'</p> <p>Copies of the report are available on the MLA website <a href="http://www.mla.gov.uk/action/archives/00archives.asp">http://www.mla.gov.uk/action/archives/00archives.asp</a> or from Central Books by emailing <a href="mailto:mo@centralbooks.com">mo@centralbooks.com</a></p> <p>[March 2004] </p> --><p><a name="9"></a></p><h2>OCLC Research announces ResearchWorks Web site</h2><p>OCLC Research announces the ResearchWorks Web site, featuring demos, prototypes, and other interactive items that showcase the current work of OCLC Researchers.</p><p>Visitors to OCLC ResearchWorks can explore the site, follow their interest from one demo to another, and comment on and discuss them with others.

The aim of the conference is to explore how the ever increasing number and variety of digital and electronic sources have changed the way in which history, and historical sources, are created, selected, researched, taught, written, presented and used. Even historians who do not use computer methodologies are likely to encounter sources in digital form or have their access to analogue sources mediated by electronic means. Whilst the digital form can transcend the constraints of time and space it brings new problems and challenges to historians and historical research. Some of the questions the this conference seeks to explore include:</p><h3>Availability and Access</h3><ul><li>On what basis are selection and prioritisation criteria made for digitisation?</li><li>Are digital resources limited by the way they are funded?</li><li>Do commercial interests dictate digitisation?</li><li>Are historians interests represented in this process?</li><li>Are digital sources the type historians need?</li><li>How are digital resources described and accessed?</li><li>What are historians' information retrieval strategies in the digital age?</li></ul><h3>Research</h3><ul><li>How do historians evaluate digital resources?</li><li>Do digital resources fundamentally differ from their analogue counterparts?</li><li>How is digitisation affecting research activity?</li><li>Does the research climate help or hinder the creation and use of digital resources?</li><li>What possibilities do 3D digitisation and virtual reality open up for historians?</li></ul><h3>Writing and Teaching</h3><ul><li>How does digitisation affect the way history is written?</li><li>How does multimedia communication alter the structure of narrative discourse?</li><li>Can historians write a 'digital history'?</li><li>What is the role of the historian in a multi-dimensional digital history?</li><li>How do digital resources affect the way history is taught?</li></ul><p>200 word abstracts are invited on any of the three themes above.

The aim of the project is to create the mod_oai Apache software module that will expose content accessible from Apache Web servers via the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). The mod_oai project is generously funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</p><p>Apache is an open-source Web server that is used by 63% - approximately 27 million - of the Websites in the world. The OAI-PMH is a protocol to selectively harvest from data repositories. The protocol has had a considerable impact in the field of digital libraries but it has yet to be embraced by the general Web community. The mod_oai project hopes to achieve such broader acceptance by making the power and efficiency of the OAI-PMH available to Web servers and Web crawlers. For example, the planned OAI-PMH interface to Apache Web servers should allow responding to requests to collect all files added or changed since a specified date, or all files that are of a specified MIME-type.</p><p>Contact: Michael Nelson <a href="mailto:mln@cs.odu.edu">mln@cs.odu.edu</a> and Herbert Van de Sompel <a href="mailto:herbertv@lanl.gov">herbertv@lanl.gov</a></p><p>More information about the mod_oai project can be found at <a href="http://www.modoai.org">http://www.modoai.org</a>.</p><p>More information about the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting can be found at <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/">http://www.openarchives.org/</a>.</p><p>More information about Apache can be found at <a href="http://www.apache.org/">http://www.apache.org/</a>.</p><p>More information about the Andrew W.

Researchers in such areas as artificial intelligence, formal and computational linguistics, biomedical informatics, conceptual modeling, knowledge engineering and information retrieval have come to realize that a solid foundation for their research calls for serious work in ontology, understood as a general theory of the types of entities and relations that make up their respective domains of inquiry. In all these areas, attention has started to focus on the content of information rather than on just the formats and languages in terms of which information is represented. The clearest example of this development is provided by the many initiatives growing up around the project of the Semantic Web. And as the need for integrating research in these different fields arises, so does the realization that strong principles for building well-founded ontologies might provide significant advantages over ad hoc, case-based solutions. The tools of Formal Ontology address precisely these needs, but a real effort is required in order to apply such philosophical tools to the domain of Information Systems. Reciprocally, research in the information science raises specific ontological questions which call for further philosophical investigations. The purpose of FOIS is to provide a forum for genuine interdisciplinary exchange in the spirit of a unified ontological analysis effort. Although the primary focus of the conference is on theoretical issues, methodological proposals as well as papers dealing with concrete applications from a well-founded theoretical perspective are welcome.</p><h3>Invited Speakers</h3><p>Peter Gärdenfors, Lund University Cognitive Science, Sweden<br>Amie Thomasson, Department of Philosophy, University of Miami, USA</p><p>For details see: <a href="http://fois2004.di.unito.it/">http://fois2004.di.unito.it/</a></p><p>[April 2004]</p><p><a name="25"></a></p><h2>Institutional Repositories - PALS Conference</h2><p>Institutional Repositories and Their Impact on Publishing<br>24 June 2004, London, UK</p><p>Institutional repositories (IRs) have been attracting increasing attention since the launch of MIT's Dspace in 2002.
