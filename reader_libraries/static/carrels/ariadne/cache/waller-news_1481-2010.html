Its launch in June 2010 will be one of the biggest changes in standards for bibliographic data management and access since MARC21 a decade ago.</p><p>RDA's launch is expected to transform cataloguing standards that have been virtually unchanged for 30 years. Existing standards, as laid out in the Anglo American Cataloguing Rules, have struggled to keep pace with new publishing formats and new publishing practices. RDA will provide a more flexible framework for resource description and access, and make bibliographic information accessible on the Web.</p><p>To help all those affected get to grips with this major strategic development, CILIP has secured leading experts from across the library and information community for a new Executive Briefing. Entitled RDA: Meeting the challenges of strategic change, it will be presented in London on 23 March 2010, and look at the new cataloguing code and its implications, highlighting the issues that really matter to those working at a strategic level.</p><p>The event will begin with Ann Chapman (UKOLN) outlining the development process, followed by an exclusive video presentation by Shawne Miksa (University of Texas) focusing on how the new code fits with traditional and newer cataloguing processes. Alan Danskin (British Library) will describe the BL perspective on the transition to RDA and demonstrate the new RDA software, followed by Anne Welsh (University College London) who considers the impact of RDA on the cataloguing community. Finally Heather Jardine (City of London Libraries) focuses on how libraries can manage the change to the new code and Gwyneth Morgan (Nielson Book) presents the suppliers perspective on the transition.</p><p>Further information:<br>For further details on this event and how to book your place, visit<br><a href="http://www.cilip.org.uk/rda-2010/">http://www.cilip.org.uk/rda-2010/</a></p><p align="right"><br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events5"></a></p><h3>Legal Issues in Web 2.0</h3><p>The Dome, 14 George Street, Edinburgh, EH2 2PF<br>Wednesday, 24 March 2010, 09.30 - 16.30<br><a href="http://www.ukeig.org.uk/training/2010/Legalissues.html">http://www.ukeig.org.uk/training/2010/Legalissues.html</a></p><h4>Course Outline</h4><p>Find out the legal issues raised by using Web 2.0 applications in libraries and information centres.

In fields ranging throughout the sciences and humanities, managing, preserving, and sharing these data require substantial capital and human resources and new kinds of information professionals who are able to integrate technology, content, and policy skills. This summit aims to bring together leaders in data centres, laboratories, and libraries in different organisational and disciplinary settings to share ideas and techniques for managing, preserving, and sharing large-scale research data repositories with an eye toward achieving infrastructure-independent access and stewardship. The summit will engage three kinds of leaders: those from projects with experience in integrating high-performance technologies; those from large-scale collaboratories in science, social science, and the humanities; and those from institutions coping with the challenges of integrating different technologies and data collections. The summit will address three main questions:</p><ul><li>What data access and preservation capabilities are required within and across research groups?</li><li>What technical solutions exist to meet these needs and how do they scale across domains?</li><li>What are the social contexts under which research communities assemble to share data?</li></ul><p>The summit will take place in Phoenix over 9-10 April 2010 at the Hyatt Regency Hotel. The plan is to have a full day (Friday) of invited panels and presentations with an evening poster and demo session (with food). The poster/demo session and 30-minute breaks between sessions are designed to maximise participant interaction. The demo session will provide an opportunity to display existing technology solutions and their application to specific research collaborations.</p><p>Saturday will be a half-day of sessions. The formal meeting ends at noon. Saturday afternoon tutorials will be given for those who wish to focus on particular concepts and systems. We expect to have a panel on each of the above questions led by leaders who have practical experience dealing with the associated challenges, and a few invited speakers. Participants will have ample opportunities to interact with speakers and each other and present techniques and concepts via posters and semi-structured discussions. Demonstrations of integrated systems that address data management challenges will be held, with opportunities to compare approaches and ask implementation details.</p><p><strong>Further information:</strong><br>More information is at: <a href="http://www.asis.org/Conferences/IA10/ResearchDataAccessSummit2010.html">http://www.asis.org/Conferences/IA10/ResearchDataAccessSummit2010.html</a></p><p><strong>Register at:</strong><br><a href="https://www.asis.org/Conferences/IA10/rdap10regform.php">https://www.asis.org/Conferences/IA10/rdap10regform.php</a><br>Early rates end 26 February 2010</p><p align="right"><br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events7"></a></p><h3>JISC Conference 2010: Technology: at the heart of education and research</h3><p>Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, London<br>12-13 April 2010<br><a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/Home/events/2010/04/jisc10.aspx">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/Home/events/2010/04/jisc10.aspx</a></p><p>This will be the 8th annual conference, bringing JISC's expertise and knowledge on technology in education to over 750 academics, IT experts, library professionals, policy makers, research staff, senior managers, students and teachers from across education within the UK and internationally.</p><p>The conference theme Technology: at the heart of education and research confirms JISC's view that universities and colleges must integrate technology into all aspects of their strategic planning to ensure their survival in the coming years.

Like physical obesity, it is not just the result of consuming too much, but is linked to declines in the information's quality, and individuals' and communities' awareness of problems which arise through over-consumption. Fitness and (mental) exercise also come into play. The consequences of information obesity may be severe if left unchecked; it will lead to a decline in our ability to manage knowledge, both in our communities and our workplaces.</p><p>As a teaching strategy, information literacy (IL) can partly help to combat the condition. However, as traditionally defined, IL does not address the ways in which the structure of organisations and our own innate cognitive biases prevent us acting as independent and self-aware evaluators of the information we find. This course will help participants understand these biases and how, through work at the community level, they may be overcome, in order that we start using information to sustain ourselves and our communities, and not just consume it unthinkingly.</p><p>This one-day course will include time for plenty of discussion and practical activity. Participants will be encouraged to share their experiences with others and also to build a network of practice after the event. Sessions will include:</p><ul><li>Identifying information obesity: structural, individual and community-level explanations</li><li>How information literacy helps: and how it is limited</li><li>Cognitive biases, and why they matter</li><li>How organisations affect the way we think</li><li>The holistic approach to IL: subjective, objective and inter-subjective value</li><li>Problem-based learning; student- and community-led research projects</li></ul><h4>Who should attend?</h4><p>Anyone working with information in formal, non-formal or informal education, who has an interest in enhancing their teaching of information studies and/or knowledge management, to students or to colleagues as part of their professional development work. This includes:</p><ul><li>information professionals;</li><li>teachers/lecturers at any level of education;</li><li>managers (particularly, but not only, those with responsibilities for information and knowledge management and dissemination);</li><li>other stakeholders in education.</li></ul><h4>Course Presenter:</h4><p>Dr Andrew Whitworth is the Programme Director for the MA: Digital Technologies, Communication and Education at the University of Manchester.

The parties concerned – including publishers – are increasingly accepting Open Access as the norm. At the Open Access seminar organised by SURF in Amsterdam, Prof. Jos Engelen, chairman of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), announced that his organisation would be providing a special Open Access budget of EUR 2.5m.</p><p>At the well-attended seminar – held to mark the conclusion of SURF's 'Open Access Year 2009' – discussion focused on the issue of how we can speed up progress towards achieving the Open Access ideal. Much has already been achieved in the Netherlands. More than 200,000 publications have now been made freely accessible via the NARCIS scientific portal. These will now be joined by publications by the lectors who organise knowledge networks at Dutch universities of applied sciences.</p><h4>Unanimity</h4><p>Leading figures from the world of Higher Education and research expressed unanimous support for the view that scientific and scholarly publications that have been financed by the taxpayer should be available online free of charge. Derk Haank, CEO of the Springer Publishing Group, went so far as to say that if scientific and scholarly publishing were to start again today, Open Access would be the logical route to pursue.</p><h4>Publishers</h4><p>The Association of Universities in the Netherlands (VSNU) has reached agreement with Springer that in 2010 all articles by Dutch researchers in Springer journals will be made available Open Access, subject to the author agreeing. Other publishers too are providing opportunities for Open Access publication because they are following Springer in allowing researchers to arrange for Open Access when publishing their articles. Almost all publishers already allow researchers to upload the definitive author's version of their article to their institution's repository.</p><h4>The Problem</h4><p>One problem for scientists and scholars is the need to publish in prestigious and expensive journals so as to receive a good rating, which is important when applying for grants from organisations such as the NWO. Prof. Engelen said that the NWO would investigate ways of ensuring that publications in Open Access would count more significantly towards the author's 'impact factor'. Paul Doop – a member of the board of Amsterdam University and Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, and chair of the ICT and Research platform board of SURFfoundation – argued that the problem could be solved by including a provision for mandatory Open Access in collective labour agreements. Many of those attending the seminar thought that was going too far. Prof. Engelen said, however, that his organisation was keeping close track of developments and that if insufficient progress had been made in a year's time, the NWO would see whether it could make Open Access obligatory, as its sister organisations in the United Kingdom and the United States have already done.</p><h4>Further information:</h4><p>Further information on the seminar and the video registration (in Dutch):<br><a href="http://www.surffoundation.nl/nl/themas/openonderzoek/OpenAccess/Pages/Default.aspx">http://www.surffoundation.nl/nl/themas/openonderzoek/OpenAccess/Pages/Default.aspx</a></p><p>NARCIS: <a href="http://www.narcis.info/">http://www.narcis.info/</a></p><p>[Source: SURF]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: February 2010</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news3"></a></p><h3>MLA: Accreditation Modernisation</h3><p>The MLA has welcomed the findings of two studies which it commissioned to help inform its review of museum Accreditation, and detailed its plans to streamline, update and refocus the scheme.</p><p>MLA Chief Executive Roy Clare said: "Accreditation has proven its value over the last 21 years.

The report recognised that online government had to mean 100% online citizens and awarded £30 million to UK online centres to help get one million people online by 2012. The first round of grant funding is now open for applications from all library services. The closing date for applications is 10 February 2010 for projects that will run from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2011.</p><p>Natasha Innocent, MLA senior policy adviser, said: "Library services are at the forefront of bridging the digital divide and supporting grassroots digital inclusion. The MLA is delighted to be working with UK online centres to promote this funding opportunity to library services. Libraries play a key role in supporting people to get online and this funding stream could support them to reach out even further to deeply excluded groups, and target areas of high deprivation and low network coverage."</p><p>Applications are welcomed from any library meeting the criteria and willing to become a member of the UK online centres network to deliver their funded project. Over the next three years, many hundreds of libraries services, ICT and support centres will benefit from funding, and from being part of a building network - sharing resources and expertise, taking advantage of new products, services, training opportunities and marketing campaigns.</p><p>Further information: <a href="http://www.mla.gov.uk/news_and_views/press/releases/2010/uk_online_funding">http://www.mla.gov.uk/news_and_views/press/releases/2010/uk_online_funding</a></p><p>[Source: MLA]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: February 2010</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news5"></a></p><h3>JISC Briefing Paper: Assessing the Business Case for Standards</h3><p>A recent briefing entitled Assessing the Business Case for Standards: An introduction for strategy planning and resourcing committees provides advice to help people incorporate standards in their ICT-related business cases.</p><p>Making a business case for interoperability and standards is a challenging task for those involved in the strategic planning of IT systems in educational institutions. This briefing written by Adam Cooper and Wilbert Kraan of JISC CETIS, is intended to provide advice and supporting materials to help people to incorporate standards in their ICT-related business cases. It assumes some familiarity with the way IT systems are presently deployed and maintained in educational institutions, and will be of interest to Information Services managers and senior managers for strategy planning and resourcing.</p><p><strong>Further information:</strong><br>The briefing is available at: <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/documents/bpbusinesscaseforstandards.aspx">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/documents/bpbusinesscaseforstandards.aspx</a></p><p>[Source: JISC CETIS]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: January 2010</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news6"></a></p><h3>Successful Reuse of Research Data Requires Integrated Approach</h3><p>On 23-24 September 2009 an international discussion workshop was held in Berlin, prepared and organised by Knowledge Exchange. The main focus of the workshop was on the benefits, challenges and obstacles of re-using data from a researcher's perspective. The most important message from the wide variety of presentations was that successful reuse not only requires efforts directed at the technical issues, but also at providing incentives for researchers, both to share and re-use.</p><p>These incentives can be provided by funding opportunities, but also by incorporating data sharing and re-use in the research assessment. The issue of data re-use would be a lot more relevant to researchers if publishers, for example, asked authors for data to underpin their publications. Alternatively researchers' data being cited in a journal should be rewarded. Technical aspects should also be addressed, e.g. by supporting data storage and sharing facilities. This requires not only specialised staff but also agreed standards (metadata, ontologies) which will allow different datasets to be evaluated, compared and combined. Researchers will need to be trained, but awareness will also need to be created at a higher level. Bottom-up and top-down approaches need to work in unison.</p><p>At the workshop the use cases presented by researchers from a variety of disciplines were supplemented by two keynotes and selected presentations by specialists from infrastructure institutions, publishers, and national and European funding bodies. Thanks to this broad approach it became clear that certain challenges and obstacles are comparable across disciplines and organisations. As a general recommendation the participants agreed that it is time to cooperate in more ambitious international activities to establish reliable and sustainable support for initiatives in the field of data related research infrastructure - as Prof. John Wood (Imperial College London) put it in his keynote: "You can no longer separate the data management issue from the planning and running of research infrastructures".</p><p>The workshop was organised by the working group Primary Research Data of Knowledge Exchange.</p><p>Further information:<br>Knowledge Exchange<br><a href="http://www.knowledge-exchange.info/">http://www.knowledge-exchange.info/</a></p><p>For further information on the workshop please see: <a href="http://www.knowledge-exchange.info/Default.aspx?ID=324">http://www.knowledge-exchange.info/Default.aspx?ID=324</a></p><p>[Source: Knowledge Exchange]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: January 2010</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news7"></a></p><h3>Libraries Bridge the Digital Divide</h3><p>New research findings highlight the key role of public libraries in opening up free online access and providing support to help people get online.</p><p>A new survey has highlighted the extent free Internet access is available to the public in libraries throughout England, during the day, in the evening and at weekends. The research, conducted by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) highlights the crucial role public libraries play in supporting the delivery of the national digital priorities set out by the Government and the Digital Champion, Martha Lane Fox.</p><p>Heads of library service, library managers and IT specialists from 112 local authorities in England took part in identifying the extent of available Internet access; support for people to get online; and digital training of library staff.</p><p>The report, prepared by CFE on behalf of the MLA, confirmed that 79 per cent of library services in English Local Authorities do not charge for internet access at all and a further 12 per cent do not make any charge for the first hour (91per cent in total). There is an average of 762 hours of Internet access available across all libraries in a Local Authority area per week. Nearly all Local Authorities (98 per cent) provide this access in the evening and at weekends with over half (59 per cent) providing Internet access on Sundays.</p><p><strong>Further information:</strong><br>'Role of public libraries in supporting and promoting digital participation' is available from the MLA page:<br><a href="http://www.mla.gov.uk/news_and_views/press/releases/2010/digital_participation">http://www.mla.gov.uk/news_and_views/press/releases/2010/digital_participation</a></p><p>[Source: MLA]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: January 2010</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news8"></a></p><h3>TV Archive Project to Supply Europeana</h3><p>EUscreen is a new project that will supply TV archive footage to Europeana. Its project Web site, www.euscreen.eu has gone live. The Web site contains a blog, information about the project and the partners, publications and events. Visitors can also subscribe to the EUscreen mailing list or follow the project on Twitter or Facebook.</p><p>EUscreen is a three-year project funded by the eContentplus Programme of the European Commission. During that time over 30,000 items that capture Europe's television heritage (videos, photographs, articles) will be channelled into Europeana. EUscreen will also develop its own multilingual portal that will specialise in information about TV archives and television research.</p><p>The portal will be launched in 2011 and will be directly connected to Europeana. The EUscreen consortium is co-ordinated by the University of Utrecht and consists of 27 partners (audiovisual archives, research institutions, technology providers and Europeana) from 19 European countries.</p><p><strong>Further information:</strong><br>Euscreen<br><a href="http://www.euscreen.eu/">http://www.euscreen.eu/</a></p><p>[Source: KB]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: January 2010</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p class="right"><a href="newsline.html#top"><small>Return to top</small></a></p><p class="footer">Publication Date: 30-January-2010 Publication: Ariadne Issue 62<br>Originating URL: http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue62/newsline/</p>
