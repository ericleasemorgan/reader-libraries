DigCCurr initiatives in support of this goal are informed by representatives from the project's collaborating institutions as well as an Advisory Board of experts from Australia, Canada, Italy, the Netherland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States.</p><p>The first symposium, DigCCurr2007: An International Symposium in Digital Curation, was held 18-20 April 2007, attracting nearly 300 attendees from ten countries. Participants explored the definition of digital curation and what skills are necessary for digital curation professionals working in libraries, archives, museums, data centers, and other data-intensive organisations. With speakers from more than a dozen countries, DigCCurr2009 will continue this theme, focusing on current practice and research surrounding digital curation with a look toward the future, and trends in preparing digital curation professionals.</p><p>Sessions Focus on:</p><ul><li>Digital curation synergies and collaboration: What are the challenges and opportunities for regional, national, and global cooperation and collaboration in digital curation practices and research? How do we approach these effectively? Where do practices and research converge and diverge across different organisational mandates and requirements? Strategies for building and leveraging relations and cooperation among a global audience of digital curation researchers and educators for improved delivery of digital curation research and practice opportunities for emerging professionals.</li><li>Teaching and training at the international level: What are the barriers and advantages in providing quality and comparable education? How does the profession traverse credentials and certification? Graduate education and continuing education for practitioners; Examination of current teaching tools; Recruiting students; Perceptions on the changing professional competencies and personal attributes for employment in digital curation environments.</li><li>Digital curation in relation to archives and museums: How is the environment shaping traditional responsibilities? How are synergies developing across libraries, archives, and museums? What are core competencies in digital curation? Can we develop common ground among participating disciplines and entities? What are implications for various professions, and what issues do the professions need to addressing separately?</li><li>What is going on in real life with the curation of digital resources? We encourage people to undertake small-scale studies in order to share data and case studies about current practices, procedures and approaches within specific organisational contexts. What is happening in different sectors such as industry, federal government, state government, nonprofit cultural institutions?</li><li>What do we need? Examination of scope, extent, relevance, and quality of current literature.</li></ul><p>What is useful? What is missing?</p><ul><li>Infrastructures in support of digital curation. How well is current technology meeting the needs of digital curation, and what should future technology research and development involve to better meet these needs? How do organisations incorporate digital curation principles and procedures into their administrative and managerial operations? How do we support sustainable infrastructure?</li></ul><p>Registration:<br><a href="http://www.ils.unc.edu/digccurr2009/registration">http://www.ils.unc.edu/digccurr2009/registration</a></p><p>Cancellations or substitutions must be made to Rachael Clemens <a href="mailto:rclemens@unc.edu">rclemens@unc.edu</a></p><p>For further information:</p><p>Dr. Helen R.

All of these projects have the same objective, namely to promote knowledge dissemination via the Internet. In this new round of projects, the SURFshare Programme allots an active role to researchers and 'lectors' (directors of research groups and knowledge networks in Universities of Applied Science): the main thing is not the infrastructure but the user. The grant from the SURFshare Programme comes to over € 630.000 on a total budget of € 1.220.000. The year-long innovation projects were submitted by institutions of Higher Education (HEIs).</p><p>There was a big response to the 2008 call for tenders, with HEIs submitting a total of 19 project proposals. One condition for receiving a grant is that a project must contribute to improving the Dutch knowledge infrastructure. In an internationally competitive knowledge economy, it is essential for the knowledge generated to find its way to researchers, educators, business and industry, and society in general.</p><p>With this new round of projects, the SURFshare Programme is taking a further step towards making research material available online, encouraging Web-based collaboration, and knowledge dissemination among 'Universities of Applied Sciences'. The projects will go a long way towards meeting the needs of users, i.e. scientists, scholars, and researchers, but also lectors. The previous call for tenders (2007) in the SURFshare Programme emphasised infrastructure. The new projects focus primarily on the user. The infrastructure is basically in place, and it is now up to users actually to make use of it.</p><p>Highly motivated and enthusiastic project teams will started work at the end of January 2009. Each project will do so in its own way, leading to a wide range of activities, including developing technical aids, carrying out research, improving existing experimental services, and ultimately presenting the final results to the SURFshare community and the Higher Education sector as a whole.</p><p>The twelve projects that have been awarded grants are:</p><p><strong>Knowledge dissemination at Universities of Applied Sciences</strong></p><ul><li>National Knowledge Forum for Care and Treatment of Addiction</li><li>Automotive Knowledge Bank for Universities of Applied Sciences</li><li>DIGIPUB – Digital Publication environments</li><li>FUTURE – Thematised Access to Expertise, Knowledge &amp; Research for SMEs, Students and Experts</li></ul><p><strong>Enriched publications</strong></p><ul><li>JALC – Journal of Archaeology in the Low Countries, enriched publications in Dutch archaeology</li><li>DatapluS – Repositories for Enhanced Survey Publications</li><li>ESCAPE – Enhanced Scientific Communication by Aggregated Publications</li></ul><p><strong>Environments</strong></p><ul><li>Theses Plus – Enriched theses in the Utrecht repository</li><li>Veteran Tapes – Enriched publication based on multidisciplinary re-use of qualitative research files</li></ul><p><strong>Collaboratories</strong></p><ul><li>Tales of the Revolt Collaboratory: Sharing, Enhancing and Disseminating Sources</li><li>Hublab-2 – Toward successful implementation of the Liferay platform in historical research</li><li>Virtual Knowledge Studio Collaboratory – Understanding Scholarly Collaboration in Practice</li></ul><p><a href="http://www.surffoundation.nl/smartsite.dws?fs=&amp;bw=&amp;ch=ENG&amp;id=14028%20">More information</a> about these projects can be found at the SURF Foundation Web site.</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: January 2009</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news7"></a></p><h2>New Guidance and Insight from the UKSG</h2><h4>Latest chapters of <em>The E-Resources Management Handbook</em></h4><p>The UK Serials Group has recently published new chapters of <em>The E-Resources Management Handbook</em>, its open access guide to the issues and challenges facing those in the information community.</p><p>Two of the new chapters follow the book's original formula by providing analyses of specific areas of e-resource management. Louise Cole, Senior Information Advisor (Collections) at Kingston University gives up-to-date guidance for UK librarians relating to copyright in the digital age.

They provide a milestone in the handbook's evolution, and a benchmark against which future developments in e-resource management can be measured.</p><p><em>The E-Resources Management Handbook</em> now incorporates 21 chapters covering licensing, statistics, archiving, resource discovery, marketing and ERM systems among many other topics. As a "living" e-book, chapters are reviewed periodically and updated when necessary – but they are never removed, even when superceded, so that the book is an evolving record of the state of the field. It has been described as "essential reading for anyone involved in the management and use of electronic resources" by Charles Oppenheim, Professor of Information Science, Loughborough University.</p><p>Planned updates for 2009 include chapters on peer review, repositories, e-learning and the semantic web.
