The programme comprises a series of peer-reviewed papers covering a range of disciplines from social sciences and neurosciences to astronomy. The programme will also focus on a number of different aspects of the curation life cycle including the management of repositories, educating the data scientist and the role of policy and strategy. There will be a panel session on Open Science.</p><p>For further information: <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/dcc-2006/">http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/dcc-2006/</a></p><p align="right"><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events2"></a></p><h3>Workshop on Semantics for Web Services (SemWS'06)</h3><p>..in conjunction with 4th European Conference on Web Services (ECOWS'06),<br>4-6 December 2006, Zurich, Switzerland. <a href="http://events.deri.at/semws06">http://events.deri.at/semws06</a></p><h4>Workshop Theme</h4><p>Semantic Web and Web Services have been envisioned as Semantic Web Services for dynamic discovery, selection, composition, negotiation and invocation of Web Services. Significant work has already been done in this decade to apply Semantic Web technologies for Web Services and a large body of relevant work exists from earlier decades, in fields such as formal languages, knowledge representation, planning, agent-based systems and artificial intelligence. Nevertheless many difficult research challenges remain, and much work is needed to adapt relevant existing technologies to the context of Web services and the Semantic Web, and to prepare the more mature models, languages, capabilities and architectures for widespread deployment.</p><p>This workshop under the umbrella of the ECOWS conference as being on of the premier conferences for both researchers and practitioners to exchange the latest advances in the state of the art and practices of Web Services, aims to cover the semantic aspects for Web Services. This workshop will provide a forum to focus on technical challenges for applying Semantic Web technologies to Web Services (i.e. Semantic Web Services), provide guidance to early adopters of Semantic Web Services technology, particularly in the business community and facilitate the formation of new communities of Semantic Web Services users.</p><p>Workshop Topics (include following, but not limited to)</p><ul><li>Semantics with W3C Web services technologies</li><li>Semantics-enabled services designs</li><li>Semantic Web technologies in Web services discovery, composition, ...</li><li>Mapping Web Services technologies to Semantic Web</li><li>Web services and agent technologies</li><li>Semantic Web and agent technologies for Web Services</li><li>OWL-S, WSMO, WSDL-S based systems</li><li>Ontologies for modeling (semantic) Web services</li><li>Formal languages for describing (semantic) Web services</li><li>Quality of services (QoS) in Web Services</li><li>Advertising, discovery, matchmaking, selection, and brokering of (semantic) Web services</li><li>Semantic Web Services architectures, tools, middleware</li><li>Security and privacy for (semantic) Web services</li><li>Use cases for using semantics in Web Services</li></ul><p>For further information: Omair Shafiq <a href="mailto:omair.shafiq@deri.org">omair.shafiq@deri.org</a></p><p align="right"><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events3"></a></p><h3>Discovery and Access: Standards and the Information Chain</h3><p>Thursday 7 December 2006, London</p><p>JISC is holding a seminar on standards and the information chain, co-sponsored by ALPSP, the Publishers Association, and CrossRef. Academic users want to discover and get access to relevant publications quickly and easily. Publishers, intermediaries, libraries, and their solutions vendors all develop services to make this happen. This seminar is about how they can use standards more effectively to share data about publications and enable these services.</p><p>Using standards is more than a technical issue. The seminar will cover what key standards are important, why they are important, and what they support at the user end of the information chain. It will also cover new developments and innovative applications. It will conclude with a panel discussion on the future and what needs to happen from different stakeholder perspectives. The aim is to explore how publishers, intermediaries, libraries, and their solutions vendors can use standards more effectively and agree any action needed to move things forward.</p><p>JISC has done much work to specify the standards for information environments at the user end. JISC has also worked with publishers on standards through the PALS Metadata and Interoperability Group and by funding projects to explore the innovative use of key standards. This seminar is an opportunity for all participants in the information chain to reflect on where we are, share views, and agree how to move things forward in a collaborative way.</p><p>Publishers, intermediaries, librarians, and solutions vendors are all invited, and there is no charge to attend the seminar.</p><p>For further information, the programme and an online booking form: <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/events/pals-2006/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/events/pals-2006/</a></p><p>[Source: Christine Baldwin, Programme Manager, JISC PALS 2 Programme]</p><p align="right"><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events4"></a></p><h3>Technical Advisory Service for Images Workshops</h3><p>TASI courses enable you to get hands-on experience of using digital imaging equipment and software allowing you to experiment, with the supervision and guidance of a professional practitioner.

Like GEANT2, the successful European network for computing resources, data storage and transport, the new DRIVER repository infrastructure will enable researchers to plug into the new knowledge base and use scientific content in a standardised, open way. The project is funded by the European Commission under the auspices of the "Research Infrastructure" unit.</p><p>Open Access to research information is vital for researchers and helps the public appreciation and understanding of science. DRIVER will be helping countries to create networks of openly-accessible repositories for research information.</p><p>The project is a joint collaboration between ten international partners with the intention to create a knowledge base of European research. DRIVER will put a test-bed in place across Europe to assist the development of a knowledge infrastructure for the European Research Area. The project will develop over the next 18 months, building upon existing institutional repositories and networks, from countries including the Netherlands, Germany, France, Belgium and the UK. The aim is for one large-scale virtual content resource to be created to access and integrate individual repositories. DRIVER will also prepare for the future expansion and upgrade of the Digital Repository infrastructure across Europe and will ensure the widest possible user involvement.</p><p>Workshops will be run to establish communication and act as open forums for discussion and feedback to assist the development of the infrastructure and will facilitate the set-up and international networking of institutional repositories for the envisioned European DR infrastructure.</p><p>The DRIVER Consortium:</p><ul><li>University of Athens, Greece</li><li>Bielefeld University, Germany</li><li>Consiglio Nazionale Delle Ricerche, Italy</li><li>STICHTING SURF, Netherlands</li><li>University of Nottingham, United Kingdom</li><li>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique DIS, France</li><li>University of Bath, United Kingdom</li><li>Uniwesytet Warszawski, Poland</li><li>Universiteit Gent, Belgium</li><li>Goettingen University, Germany</li></ul><p>More information is available from:</p><p>The Project Web site: <a href="http://www.driver-repository.eu/">http://www.driver-repository.eu/</a> the individual project partners from participating countries or the project coordinators: Prof. Mike Hatzopolous (administrative) <a href="mailto:mike@di.uoa.gr">mike@di.uoa.gr</a> and Dr. Norbert Lossau (scientific-technical) <a href="mailto:norbert.lossau@uni-bielefeld.de">norbert.lossau@uni-bielefeld.de</a></p><p>[Source: Bill Hubbard, SHERPA Manager]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: November 2006</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news2"></a></p><h3>Open-source Web Curator Tool developed by the National Library of New Zealand and the British Library</h3><p>The National Library of New Zealand Te Puna Matauranga o Aotearoa, The British Library and Sytec, a subsidiary of TelstraClear, have announced the successful development of a web harvesting management system to be shared with other organisations around the world as open source software. Its initial release is now available, along with documentation on installation and operation. Further details are available below.</p><p>The system, known as the Web Curator Tool, is the latest development in the practice of Web harvesting (using software to 'crawl' through a specified section of the World Wide Web, and gather 'snapshots' of Web sites, including the images and documents posted on them). The Web Curator Tool is a further advance in the race to ensure the world's digital heritage is preserved for future generations and not lost through obsolescence and the temporary nature of the Web. The National Library of New Zealand and The British Library aim to integrate the Web Curator Tool into their own digital preservation programmes.</p><p>The Web Curator Tool has been developed as an enterprise class solution. It is interoperable with other organisational systems and has a user-centred design. The Web Curator Tool enables users to select, describe and harvest online publications without requiring an in-depth knowledge of Web harvesting technology. It is auditable, has workflows and identifies the content for archiving and then manages it, including permissions, selection, descriptions, scoping, harvesting and quality review.</p><p>The partnership was brought together under the auspices of the International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC), with members contributing to initial requirements. The project goal was to find a desktop solution to the challenge of collecting Web material that would allow widespread implementation of Web harvesting without requiring a high level of technical understanding. The project was funded entirely by the national libraries.</p><ul><li>Now available for download from <a href="http://webcurator.sf.net/">http://webcurator.sf.net/</a><ul><li>Manuals</li><li>Source code (Released under Apache License, Version 2.0)</li><li>Documentation: user and administrator guides, FAQ</li><li>Mailing lists</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>for more information, visit <a href="http://webcurator.sf.net">http://webcurator.sf.net</a></li><li>for enquiries please email: <a href="mailto:wct@natlib.gov.nz">wct@natlib.gov.nz</a> ; <a href="mailto:wct@bl.uk">wct@bl.uk</a></li></ul><p>Editor's note: <em>Ariadne</em> will carry a main article on this topic in its winter issue.</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: October 2006</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news3"></a></p><h3>Dutch National Site for Doctoral Theses Officially Launched</h3><p>Professor Blom, the University Rector of the Radboud University Nijmegen, has launched the National site for Doctoral Theses 'Promise of Science' on behalf of all University Rectors in the Netherlands.
