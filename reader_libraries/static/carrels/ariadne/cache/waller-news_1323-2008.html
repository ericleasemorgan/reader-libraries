This one-day introductory course will chart a path through the complexities of these subjects. Each area will be succinctly overviewed and the key aspects of the legal regime and requirements in each area will be outlined and explained. Delegates will be taken step-by-step through the fundamentals of each area. An understanding of each topic will be illuminated by real-life examples or scenarios explaining the application of the laws in a wide range of contexts. The day will also highlight the inter-relationships between each of these important areas of information law. There will be opportunities for discussion and exchanges of experience. The day will close with a presentation on how to manage legal compliance actively in these areas in an institutional or organisational context.</p><p>The sessions will include:</p><ul><li>Copyright: everything the information professional needs to know</li><li>Copyright in action: scenarios and key issues in copyright in an electronic context</li><li>Data protection: overview of the data protection regime for information professionals</li><li>Data protection in action: specific issues in information, publishing and library contexts</li><li>Freedom of information: outline of UK freedom of information laws (including Scotland)</li><li>Freedom of information in action: compliance and making it work for information professionals</li><li>Accessibility and disability discrimination law: overview of the legal regime</li><li>Accessibility in action: key issues in provision of digital information and services to users</li><li>Managing compliance with information laws in your organisation</li></ul><h4>Who should attend</h4><p>The course is relevant to anyone involved with the legal issues relating to the creation, storage, accessing, publishing or use of information.

This workshop aims to help the non-specialist navigate successfully across this unfamiliar territory, pointing out useful shortcuts and pitfalls to avoid, and showcasing examples of good practice that can help inspire us in the use of a wide spectrum of information resources ranging from historic manuscripts to genomic databanks. Achieving holistic management of such diverse resources to allow easy correlation of their information content is challenging, especially for small information units and &lsquo;one-man-bands&rsquo;. Developing technologies may offer new opportunities but can themselves produce new demands in devising effective strategies for their use. This workshop is an opportunity to share experiences and float ideas in areas where there are as yet few &lsquo;right answers&rsquo;!</p><p>The workshop will comprise a mix of presentations and group discussion. Topics are expected to range over:</p><ul><li>Locating sources: what to look for and where to look</li><li>Digital libraries and repositories: creating and searching</li><li>Embedded images: searching within documents</li><li>Metadata content and ontologies: requirements for effective retrieval</li><li>Rights issues and commercial factors</li><li>Storage and preservation: short- and long-term issues</li><li>Using images in teaching and learning: the role of the information specialist</li><li>The impact of social networking tools: salvation or hype?</li></ul><h4>Who should attend</h4><p>Anyone whose work involves the use of images will benefit from this meeting, from any sector - university, college, government, NHS, charity, learned society, commercial etc. We hope for a good mix as we all have much to learn from each other!</p><h4>Presenters:</h4><p>A panel of speakers will be chaired by <strong>Roger Mills</strong>, Bio- and Environmental Sciences Librarian, Oxford University Library Services.

You can be forgiven for doubting that it even exists in fact, or if it does, will it really make any kind of difference to what you do as an information professional, and how you serve the different client groups that you have.</p><p>Rather than spend a lot of time wondering and worrying about the theoretical aspects perhaps the best way to view the use of Web 2.0 is to consider practical aspects - what exactly can information professionals do with these tools?</p><h4>The course will include:</h4><p>A session to ground the concept of Web 2.0 in terms of practicalities.</p><p>How to use a variety of different tools, both in order to save you time and effort in your daily work, but also how to use them to help clients. Some of the tools covered will be start pages, building your own search engines, creating Web sites without technical knowledge, using community knowledge with social networking tools, and keeping colleagues up to date with weblogs and bookmarking tools.</p><p>The course will have a strong practical element, and delegates will go away having created tools that they will then be able to pick up when back and work and start to use.</p><h4>Who should attend:</h4><p>Information professionals who are involved in current awareness services, selective dissemination of information, those who need to research subject areas and keep up to speed on them and professionals who offer quick reference services. In fact, anyone who wants to save time and work more effectively! A technical background or knowledge is certainly not required or needed. Delegates should have access to personal email accounts such as Hotmail or Gmail since they will need to register with various tools before using them.</p><p>Please note: Places on this course are strictly limited because of access to PCs so please book early to avoid disappointment.</p><h4>Course Presenter: Phil Bradley</h4><p>Phil Bradley is well known as a librarian and Internet consultant who has close ties with both CILIP and UKeiG.

Proper understanding of the significant properties of digital objects is critical to establish best practices and helps answer the fundamental question related to digital preservation: what to preserve?</p><p>The importance of significant properties has been highlighted by a number of notable digital preservation initiatives in recent years. These include a range of projects funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) and the European Union, in which work has been undertaken to investigate the factors affecting decisions on significant properties, to establish generic models for determining them, to develop tools and services for describing and extracting them, or simply to understand complex digital object types, using the concept of significant properties as a starting point.</p><p>JISC, the British Library and the Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC) are organising a joint workshop on 7 April 2008 at the British Library Conference Centre, London. The intention is to bring together the relevant projects and report on progress to date. It is also hoped that the workshop will lead to collective recommendations for future areas of research and development. The workshop should in addition further our understanding of and provide insight into a number of specific types of digital objects, including documents, images, software, scientific data, government records and e-learning objects.</p><h4>Who should attend?</h4><p>Repository managers, librarians, archivists, information management specialists, software vendors, service providers.</p><h4>Benefits of Attendance</h4><ul><li>An opportunity to input into future research and development in the area of significant properties</li><li>To get up to speed with the outcomes from the major projects already working in this important area</li><li>To gain an understanding of some of the issues and challenges when dealing with complex digital objects</li></ul><p>Full details of the programme and registration will be announced shortly on: <a href="http://www.dpconline.org/graphics/events/080407workshop.html">http://www.dpconline.org/graphics/events/080407workshop.html</a></p><p align="right"><br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events8"></a></p><h2>Open Repositories 2008</h2><p>1 - 4 April 2008<br>Southampton, UK<br><a href="http://or08.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">http://or08.ecs.soton.ac.uk/</a></p><p>Repositories play a pivotal role in the evolving scholarly information environment of open access research outputs and scholarly collections.

Metadata is part of the fabric of social computing, which includes the use of wikis, blogs, and tagging for collaboration and participation. Metadata also underlies the development of semantic applications, and the Semantic Web &ndash; the representation and integration of multimedia knowledge structures on the basis of semantic models. These two trends flow together in applications such as Wikipedia, where authors collectively create structured information that can be extracted and used to enhance access to and use of information sources.</p><p>DC-2008 will explore conceptual and practical issues in the development and deployment of semantic and social applications to meet the needs of specific communities of practice.</p><p>Papers, reports, and poster submissions are welcome on a wide range of metadata topics, such as:</p><ul><li>Metadata generation (methods, tools, and practices)</li><li>Semantic Web metadata and applications</li><li>Conceptual models and frameworks (e.g., RDF, DCAM, OAIS)</li><li>Social tagging</li><li>Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) and Simple Knowledge Organization Systems (SKOS) (e.g., ontologies, taxonomies, authority files, folksonomies, and thesauri)</li><li>Metadata in e-Science and grid applications</li><li>Metadata interoperability and internationalization</li><li>Metadata quality, normalization, and mapping</li><li>Cross-domain metadata uses (e.g., record keeping, preservation, institutional repositories)</li><li>Vocabulary registries and registry services</li><li>Domain metadata (e.g., for corporations, cultural memory institutions, education, government, and scientific fields)</li><li>Application profiles</li><li>Accessibility metadata</li><li>Search engines and metadata</li><li>Metadata principles, guidelines, and best practices</li><li>Bibliographic standards (e.g., Resource Description and Access (RDA), Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), subject headings) as Semantic Web vocabularies</li></ul><p>All submissions will be peer-reviewed by the International Programme Committee and published in the conference proceedings.</p><h4>Online Submission:</h4><p>Authors wishing to submit papers, reports, or poster proposals may do so through the DCMI Peer Review System at <a href="http://www.dcmipubs.org/ojs/index.php/pubs/">http://www.dcmipubs.org/ojs/index.php/pubs/</a></p><p>Author registration and links to the submission process appear under the &ldquo;Information for Authors&rdquo; link.</p><h4>Deadlines and Important Dates</h4><p>Papers/reports/posters submission: 30 March 2008<br>Acceptance notification: 15 May 2008<br>Camera-ready copy due: 15 June 2008</p><p align="right"><br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><hr><p><a name="events11"></a></p><h2>ALT-C 2008: Rethinking the digital divide</h2><p>9-11 September 2008, Leeds, England<br><a href="http://www.alt.ac.uk/altc2008/">http://www.alt.ac.uk/altc2008/</a></p><h4>Keynote speakers:</h4><ul><li><strong>David Cavallo</strong>, Chief Learning Architect for One Laptop per Child, and Head of the Future of Learning Research Group at MIT Media Lab;</li><li><strong>Dr Itiel Dror</strong>, Senior Lecturer in Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Southampton;</li><li><strong>Hans Rosling</strong>, Professor of International Health, Karolinska Institute, Sweden, and Director of the Gapminder Foundation.</li></ul><p>Proposals should address up to three of the conference dimensions: global or local; institutional or individual; pedagogy or technology; access or exclusion; open or proprietary; private or public; for the learner or by the learner.</p><p>For more detail on these, see: <a href="http://www.alt.ac.uk/altc2008/papers.html">http://www.alt.ac.uk/altc2008/papers.html</a></p><p>The online submission system for ALT-C 2008 is now open at: <a href="https://alt.conference-services.net/">https://alt.conference-services.net/</a></p><p>Prior to submitting please read the Guidelines for Research Papers and for Abstracts - <a href="http://www.alt.ac.uk/guidelines_papers.html">http://www.alt.ac.uk/guidelines_papers.html</a> and download the Research Paper Template if you intend to to submit a research paper.</p><h4><em>Important note</em></h4><p>Some projects or teams will have more to report in September 2008 than they can summarise in an abstract written in February 2008.

They are an essential part of the evidence necessary to evaluate research results, and to reconstruct the events and processes leading to them. Their value increases as they are aggregated into collections and as they become more available for re-use to address new and challenging research questions. But we shall realise the value of data only if we move beyond research policies, practices and support systems developed in a different era. We need new approaches to managing and providing access to research data.</p><p>In order to address these issues, the Research Information Network (RIN) has set out a framework of key principles and guidelines which is founded on the fundamental policy objective that ideas and knowledge, including data, derived from publicly funded research should be made available for public use, interrogation, and scrutiny, as widely, rapidly and effectively as practicable. The framework, which was the subject of a consultation during 2007, was published in January 2008.</p><p>It is structured around five broad principles which provide a guide to the development of policy and practice for a range of key players: universities, research institutions, libraries and other information providers, publishers, and research funders as well as researchers themselves. Each of these principles serves as a basis for a series of questions that serves a practical purpose by pointing to how the various players might address the challenges of effective data stewardship.</p><p>The principles relate to:</p><ol><li>Roles and responsibilities of researchers, research institutions and funders;</li><li>Standards of data creation and collection, and quality assurance;</li><li>Access, usage and credit;</li><li>Benefits and cost-effectiveness of good data management;</li><li>Preservation and sustainability of data for long-term access.</li></ol><p>In seeking to develop the framework further, all parties need to work collaboratively and to ensure that it is sensitive to the needs of researchers and the different contexts in which they work. All parties must also take account of relevant technical and policy-making developments in the UK and overseas.</p><p>Full and summary versions of the framework, along with a list of relevant current initiatives and developments, can be found at: <a href="http://www.rin.ac.uk/data-principles/">http://www.rin.ac.uk/data-principles/</a></p><p>[Source: RIN]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: January 2008</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news2"></a></p><h2>Continental Visits Offer Professional Development Opportunity</h2><p>As part of the Their Past Your Future 2 Programme, Imperial War Museum is running InSite, which gives teachers and museum, library and archive educators an expenses-paid opportunity to visit Germany, the Czech Republic and Hungary in 2008.

The assessment will be done within DLF Aquifer, a Digital Library Federation initiative focused on making digital content - especially cultural heritage materials pertinent to American culture and life - easier for scholars to find and use. The grant will enable a metadata librarian and a library school intern to identify tools that could be used to improve metadata for digital material that is difficult to find and use.</p><p>&ldquo;DLF appreciates The Delmas Foundation support for this key activity,&rdquo; DLF President Carol Mandel said. &ldquo;Results of this assessment will benefit the entire cultural heritage community.&rdquo;</p><p>DLF Aquifer has developed a set of implementation guidelines designed to make metadata more effective in aggregations. To assist libraries, archives, and other cultural heritage organisations in meeting the guidelines, DLF Aquifer proposes to offer a range of mapping and remediation services. Although a number of discrete prototypes such as date normalisation and topical clustering tools have been developed, these tools are not yet robust enough to be used in production for reliable results. DLF proposes to conduct an inventory of existing tools and examine the feasibility of developing them into production services.</p><p>The Digital Library Federation, founded in 1995, is a partnership organisation of research libraries and related organisations that are pioneering the use of electronic information technologies to extend their collections and services. Through its strategic and allied members, DLF provides leadership for libraries by identifying standards and best practice for digital collections and network access; co-ordinating research and development in the libraries&rsquo; use of technology; and incubating projects and services that libraries need but cannot develop individually.</p><p>More information about DLF is available at <a href="http://www.diglib.org/">http://www.diglib.org/</a></p><p>[Source: DLF]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: February 2008</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news4"></a></p><h2>What Young People Have a Right to Expect from Their Library</h2><p>A statement defining what young people should be entitled to in their local library has been launched this week. The statement is part of the wider agenda to ensure children and young people, both through schools and other institutions such as libraries, have increasing access to cultural services and learning opportunities.</p><p>Launching the offer at a conference at Local Government House, MLA Director of Policy Sue Wilkinson said: &ldquo;This is a short, simple, but very significant statement designed to help all councils ensure that the local library is a free, safe and welcoming space where young people can meet and access relevant and up-to-date books and other information.&rdquo;</p><p>Young people should expect from their library:</p><ul><li>Participation in shaping the future of library services</li><li>Volunteering opportunities with younger or older library users</li><li>A place to develop citizenship skills and community engagement</li><li>Free, safe and welcoming spaces in the local community</li><li>Formal and informal learning support for educational attainment</li><li>Inspiring books and reading materials supported by positive activities</li><li>Information on education, training and careers opportunities</li></ul><p>Miranda McKearney, Director of the Reading Agency, said: &ldquo;Libraries are changing fast; becoming the place of choice for more young people! They have a key role to play in helping local authorities achieve their ambitions for and with young people. The new offer articulates the richness of what libraries can do for young people, and the need to involve young people in shaping future services.&rdquo;</p><p>The offer has been developed as a result of consultation with young people from across the country about what they want and expect their local library to provide. It follows on from the national libraries change programme Fulfilling their Potential, which has inspired innovative partnership projects with young people, including the HeadSpace&trade; Big Lottery project.</p><p>The statement has been developed by the National Youth Libraries Board, a partnership chaired by the MLA and managed by the Reading Agency.

This is as true in education and research as it is in everyday life.</p><p>Following two 12-month projects to investigate identity management in Higher Education and the levels of assurance needed to prove an individual&rsquo;s identity, JISC has just published two reports which both provide important findings on Higher Education&rsquo;s current practice and approaches to identity management.</p><p><a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/publications/identityprojectfinalreport">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/publications/identityprojectfinalreport</a></p><h4>The Identity Project</h4><p>The Identity Project report reviews how identity is being addressed across UK Higher Education and, in more detail, at 10 representative institutions. Identifying the need for greater understanding of some of the key issues involved in identity management, it also calls for improved documentation and standards, greater awareness and training amongst staff and the introduction of regular audits to ensure implementation of appropriate measures across the institution.</p><h4>e-Infrastructure Security: Levels of Assurance</h4><p>Levels of assurance (LoAs) are about how much proof is needed of an individual&rsquo;s identity to access online resources; whether via a simple user name and password or a more complex system of biometrics and tokens. The JISC report on levels of assurance looks at how LoAs can be defined, agreed and then applied to different resources.</p><p>For more information: <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/publications/einfrastructurefinalreport">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/publications/einfrastructurefinalreport</a></p><p>Among the findings of this report is that 70% of respondents think that more valuable or sensitive resources should be protected by a stronger form of user identification and authentication than they currently have. Furthermore, almost all respondents (92%) were willing to respect national or international standards in this area, underlining the importance of national approaches and the interoperability of standards.</p><p>James Farnhill, JISC Programme Manager, said, &lsquo;Identity is becoming increasingly important in society, meaning that students and staff in Further and Higher Education are starting to ask what their institution is doing to manage their identities. This means that all systems, including those in functions not normally associated with identity such as Human Resources [Personnel] and Finance, are going to have to face the new challenges being posed by identity. JISC is addressing identity management in a number of ways, including the commissioning and publication of these important reports, in order to help institutions offer enhanced services to their staff and students in a safe environment.&rsquo;</p><p>For further information, please go to:</p><p><strong>Identity</strong><br><a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/publications/identityprojectfinalreport">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/publications/identityprojectfinalreport</a><br>and <strong>ES-LoA</strong><br><a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/publications/einfrastructurefinalreport">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/publications/einfrastructurefinalreport</a></p><p>[Source: JISC]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: December 2007</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p class="right"><a href="newsline.html#top"><small>Return to top</small></a></p><!-- this group of ssi's will work only when Ariadne 38 folder is in place with the relevant ssi files added --><p class="footer">Publication Date: 30-January-2008 Publication: Ariadne Issue 54<br>Originating URL: <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue54/newsline/">http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue54/newsline/</a></p></p>
