Detecting and Deterring Plagiarism: The Web: Hindrance or Help? Tuesday 22nd March 2005</p><p>This is a practical workshop aimed at staff in Further and Higher Education institutions which wish to find out more about the impact of the Web on plagiarism, and how to deal with it. As well as gaining a thorough understanding of issues concerned with plagiarism, participants will also explore essay banks, online plagiarism detection services, and, through discussions and scenarios, consider different approaches to deterring plagiarism.</p><p>2. An Internet Highway Code: Staying Safe, Secure and Legal Online Wednesday 23rd March 2005</p><p>Despite the protection offered by institutional systems and procedures, both providers and users of Web services can still face real risks when online. New evidence suggests that it is people, as much as technology, who compromise security and that many are not aware of the legal, moral and ethical implications of being online and how their actions can have serious repercussions for themselves and their employers.</p><p>Full details of these workshops, together with booking forms are available from the Netskills Web site: <a href="http://www.netskills.ac.uk/workshops/forthcoming.html"> <a href="http://www.netskills.ac.uk/workshops/forthcoming.html">http://www.netskills.ac.uk/workshops/forthcoming.html</a> </a></p><p align="right"><br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events5"></a></p><h3>Initial Call for Papers Shock of the Old 2005: Implementing Innovation</h3><p>7 April 2005 University of Oxford, <a href="http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ltg/events/shock2005/">http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ltg/events/shock2005/</a></p><p>The Learning Technologies Group at Oxford University Computing Services is pleased to announce our fifth annual one-day conference on educational technologies. This conference will explore the issues arising from using educational technology to bring about innovation in academic practice. Rather than concentrating solely on the technology itself, papers are invited that will additionally discuss the cultural and organisational factors which hinder true innovation from occurring. What are the key factors that impact on the implementation and adoption of innovation in e-learning?</p><p>We would like to receive abstracts for talks describing how individuals or groups have tackled the implementation of innovative new practices at their own Institution, discussing which challenges were faced, and which problems still remain to be overcome.</p><p>Proposals in the following areas are particularly encouraged:</p><ul><li>Empowering students to create their own learning resources, from simple web sites to creating their own computer games</li><li>Using novel forms of assessment, particularly initiatives to replace summative assessment by computer based examinations</li><li>Sharing and self-publishing academic content, in particular managing the legality of publishing through unconventional means</li><li>Personal publishing for students. What issues arise if students are introduced to discussion boards, weblogs and Personal Development Planners?</li><li>Utilising new channels of communication. Are PDAs, mobile phones and handheld devices useful tools in our armoury?</li></ul><p>In keeping with the theme of innovation, and in order make the day as useful as possible, we request that papers take the format of a formal presentation, and have an interactive element with the audience.</p><p>Talks that describe or demonstrate specific projects, tools and technologies are welcome, but we will give priority to those that do so within the context of the conference questions.</p><p>As last year, this conference will be in conjunction with the &ldquo;Beyond debate&rdquo; on the following day, which will be advertised shortly.</p><p>Please send 300 word abstracts (in-message or RTF) to ltg@oucs.ox.ac.uk Email submissions strongly encouraged! (but address and fax below) DUE DATE: Monday 14th February, 5:00pm.</p><p>If you have questions, please contact the coordinators:<br>Peter Robinson: <a href="mailto:peter.robinson@oucs.ox.ac.uk">peter.robinson@oucs.ox.ac.uk</a><br>Sophie Clarke: <a href="mailto:sophie.clarke@oucs.ox.ac.uk">sophie.clarke@oucs.ox.ac.uk</a></p><p>Learning Technologies Group<br>Oxford University Computing Services<br>13 Banbury Road, Oxford OX2 6NN<br>Tel: 01865 273221 | Fax: 01865 273275</p><p align="right"><br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events5.1"></a></p><h3>Joint Workshop on Electronic Publishing by DELOS, SVEP and ScieCom</h3><p>14-15 April, 2005 - Lund, Sweden: <a href="http://www.lub.lu.se/epubl_2005_Lund/">http://www.lub.lu.se/epubl_2005_Lund/</a></p><p>Lund University Libraries are arranging a two-day event on aspects of electronic publishing.

It cautions that the next waves of innovative ICT systems and applications may significantly shape and re-shape the digital landscape in which heritage organisations reside. For many organisations this could result in becoming &lsquo;blind spots&rsquo; in an emerging ambient intelligence environment.

Back in 2002, MLA launched a Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS)-funded programme worth £30m a year to transform museums in England&rsquo;s regions. The North East, South West and West Midlands received significant levels of Renaissance in the Regions funding and the result has been a resounding success. A 30% increase in museum visits by school children has been matched by major improvements in collections display and care resulting in significant increases in the loan of collections from the national museums.</p><p>DCMS has now allocated additional funding to bring the long-term investment up to £45 million by 2008. In the light of the successes achieved by the pilot regions, MLA&rsquo;s Board has agreed that this new funding should be used to raise consistently levels of investment in services in the remaining six English regions.</p><p>Welcoming the MLA Board&rsquo;s decision, Arts Minister Estelle Morris said: &ldquo;<em>Three years ago the Government decided to put investment directly into the best of our regional collections through the Renaissance programme. This was a first for us, and showed our commitment to supporting the whole of the museums community. Further funding was announced last year. I am delighted that the MLA have decided to use this money to get a nationwide programme underway so that everyone, regardless of where they live, will get better access to the best of our cultural heritage.</em>&ldquo;</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: January 2005</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p class="right"><a href="newsline.html#top"><small>Return to top</small></a></p><!-- this group of ssi's will work only when Ariadne 38 folder is in place with the relevant ssi files added --><p class="footer">Publication Date: 30-January-2005<br>Publication: Ariadne Issue 42<br>Originating URL: <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue42/newsline/">http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue42/newsline/</a></p></p>
