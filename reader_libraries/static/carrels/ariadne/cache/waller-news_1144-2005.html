Firstly, case studies and examples that illustrate in a practical way the progress that has been made during 2005 will be presented, followed by two sessions dealing with the e-information itself. How FOI affects the methods by which information and especially e-information is handled, and new opportunities for exploiting e-information will be described.</p><p>Finally, the meeting will cover the role of the information professional. Where do information professionals, in whatever guise, fit in? Are those not formally trained in information management now running FOI activities? Does it matter? Are traditional information skills such as organisation, retrieval, and handling enquiries being used or is the wheel being re-invented? This meeting hopes to explore these issues, answer the questions and stimulate lively discussions.</p><p>Topics to be covered include:</p><ul><li>Summary of progress to date</li><li>Examples of best practice</li><li>E-information practice - using disclosure logs</li><li>E-information opportunities - using FOI as a research tool</li><li>The role of the information professional - a lost opportunity</li><li>Looking ahead - new initiatives for the future</li></ul><p>Course Presenter: Steve Wood<br><strong>Steve Wood</strong> is a Senior lecturer in Information Management at Liverpool John Moores University. He lectures and researches on FOI and e-business areas. He is editor of a Freedom of Information Act Blog and founding editor of Open Government: a journal on freedom of information.<br><br>Other speakers include <strong>Tim Turner</strong>, FOI Officer, Wigan Council and <strong>Guy Daines</strong>, Policy Advisor at CILIP.</p><p>To register your interest in this meeting, reserve a place by 16 November, or request further details, please email <a href="mailto:meetings@ukeig.org.uk">meetings@ukeig.org.uk</a>.<br><br>Further details are also available via the UKeiG Web site at <a href="http://www.ukeig.org.uk/">http://www.ukeig.org.uk/</a><br><br>Alternatively contact:<br>Christine Baker<br>Tel &amp; Fax 01969 663749<br>Email: <a href="mailto:cabaker@ukeig.org.uk">cabaker@ukeig.org.uk</a></p><p align="right"><br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p>{C}{C}<!-- <a name="events6"></a><h3>Item 6</h3> <p align="right"><br /> <small><a href="#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p> <hr /> -->{C}{C}<!--news starts here --></p><p><a name="news1"></a></p><h3>People's Network Launches Enquire, Discover and Read</h3><p>England's public libraries are joining forces to provide a suite of new online services - Enquire, Discover and Read.</p><p>Managed by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) the new services will be available for the first time from a single national Web site for public libraries with 24-hour/7-days a week library services to help answer any question, guide users through the Web and explore books and reading online.</p><p>The Enquire service will give the public online access around the clock to library and information staff.

RDA is built on the foundations established by AACR and will provide a comprehensive set of guidelines and instructions on resource description and access covering all types of content and media. The new standard is being developed for use primarily in libraries, but consultations are being undertaken with other major stakeholders (e.g. system developers, metadata communities, MARC format developers, and international programmes such as the Program for Cooperative Cataloging, the ISSN International Centre, and IFLA) in an effort to attain an effective level of alignment between RDA and the metadata standards used in those communities. RDA is due to be published in 2008.</p><p>A Prospectus has been produced to provide information about RDA. The document is in three parts:</p><ul><li>the prospectus text</li><li>a draft outline of the chapters of RDA</li><li>a sample text to demonstrate the style and layout of RDA</li></ul><p>The Prospectus and more detailed information of some of the areas to be incorporated into the new standard can be found on the Joint Steering Committee Web site: <a href="http://www.collectionscanada.ca/jsc/">http://www.collectionscanada.ca/jsc/</a></p><p>The work of the JSC relies heavily on the members of the constituent organisations. The UK's interests on the JSC are represented by CILIP (Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals) and the British Library. There are six JSC constituencies - the other four are the American Library Association, the Australian Committee on Cataloguing, the Canadian Committee on Cataloguing and the Library of Congress joint Committee on Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules.</p><p>CILIP draws its representatives from a variety of library and cataloguing agencies. Together with representatives from the British Library they form the CILIP/BL joint Committee on Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules.

The awards acknowledge excellence and imagination in the provision of information to disabled people and others severely disadvantaged by lack of appropriate information. The citation noted that "the selection panel were impressed by the innovatory aspect of the service, the fact that it is free and the sheer scale of the resource".</p><p>Revealweb is a free Internet database that brings together information details of over 100,000 books and information in alternative formats available from more than 200 organisations in the UK. It offers a choice of formats, including audiocassettes, Braille, talking books, large and giant print, Moon, Braille music, tactile graphics and audio-described videos and information about new titles is continuously added. A complementary register of suppliers gives information on services for visually impaired people. Revealweb has already received a Commendation of Widening Access to Information in the 2005 Jodi Mattes Awards and was praised in the House of Commons Select Committee report on public libraries.

This is up 18% compared to a similar question asked in a study carried out in 2004 by the same researchers, a two-and-a-half-fold increase in just twelve months. BioMed Central has welcomed the fact that independent research is now available to confirm its own experience of the continuing growth of open access publishing.</p><p>"New Journal Publishing Models: An International Survey of Senior Researchers" was produced by CIBER, an independent publishing think tank based at City University in London. The study, published in September 2005, is based on a survey of 5513 authors "typically principal investigators or research group leaders" who had published in an ISI-indexed journal during 2004. It is the follow up to a previous CIBER study conducted in 2004.</p><p>Ian Rowlands and Dave Nicholas, the authors of the report, found that "the research community is now much more aware of the open access issue." The report authors write "There has been a large rise in authors knowing quite a lot about open access (up 10 percentage points from the 2004 figure) and a big fall in authors knowing nothing at all about open access (down 25 points)."</p><p>30% of authors surveyed claimed to know "a lot" or "quite a lot" about open access journals. This is up from 18% in the 2004 survey. Altogether 81% of authors claim to have some awareness of open access, up from 66% in 2004.</p><p>Rowlands and Nicholas found that "Authors strongly believe that, as a result of open access, articles will become more accessible". 75% of authors surveyed agreed with the statement "High prices make it difficult to access the journals literature".</p><p>The researchers also found that "senior authors and researchers believe downloads to be a more credible measure of the usefulness of research than traditional citations." Open access has been shown elsewhere to lead higher downloads of articles. According to PNAS publisher Ken Fulton, "PNAS Open Access articles receive 50% more full-text accesses and PDF downloads than subscription-access articles in the first month after publication and maintain higher usage in subsequent months." The average research article published in BioMed Central's journals in the last year has received more than 1100 accesses in the first 3 months following publication, and BioMed Central recently introduced a "Highly accessed" logo to identify those articles which have received a large number of accesses for their age.</p><p>The CIBER report was commissioned by the Publishers Association and the International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers.
