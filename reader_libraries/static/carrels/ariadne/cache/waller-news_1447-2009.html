However, the same technology also makes it easier to spot cases of plagiarism by rapidly comparing sequences of text against large databases of existing published material. This seminar will explore the technologies available for detecting potential cases of plagiarism and their practical application to the publishing workflow.

Doctorow doesn't predict much of a future for either: 'I see annihilation ahead for copyright and the entertainment industry in their present form,' he says. But on the positive side, he does predict that they will reform into 'something smaller and nimbler.' Doctorow encourages librarians to get involved with online activism: "the ALA's Office of Intellectual Freedom and IFLA have been kicking ass and taking names for years now, especially at the World Intellectual Property Organization; they need active support from librarians". For library patrons, Doctorow thinks that the top issues are "net-nannies that spy on their clickstreams and DRM that spy on their reading."</p><p>Dr Peter Murray-Rust is a Cambridge professor of chemistry, a proponent of Open Source and a library observer. He is concerned that libraries – and particularly academic libraries used for scientific research – will soon become obsolete as researchers bypass both library collections and libraries in favour of the Internet. 'There is a need for purchasing which should be done nationally by specialists,' says Murray-Rust, 'but most of the rest will be web-based.' On the other hand, he sees 'limitless' opportunity in the development of the semantic web, where innovations to watch include Google Wave, a communication and collaboration tool which is 'interactive, pervasive, communal, universal and Open' and 'computational knowledge engine' Wolfram Alpha: 'a dark horse that goes beyond OWL-based reasoning.' Both keynotes promise to be hard-hitting, challenging, radical and thought-provoking, and essential listening for information professionals as the libraries of the future emerge from the libraries of today.</p><p>Internet Librarian International takes place at Novotel London West in London on 15 &amp; 16 October 2009 with pre-conference workshops on 14 October.</p><h4>Further information:</h4><p>Novotel London West, London<br>15 - 16 October 2009 – pre-conference workshops 14 October<br><a href="http://www.internet-librarian.com/">http://www.internet-librarian.com/</a><br><br>The <strong>full conference programme</strong> can be viewed at:<br><a href="http://www.internet-librarian.com/2009/programme.php">http://www.internet-librarian.com/2009/programme.php</a><br><br>and <strong>details of 40% discounts</strong> for colleagues are available at<br><a href="http://www.internet-librarian.com/2009/registration.php">http://www.internet-librarian.com/2009/registration.php</a><br><br>or <strong>contact the organisers</strong>:<br>Information Today<br>Email: <a href="mailto:info@internet-librarian.com">info@internet-librarian.com</a><br>Tel: +44 (0)1865 327813</p><p>[Source: Information Today]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: July 2009</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p>

<h2>Koninklijke Bibliotheek Completes National Bibliography</h2>
<p>Prestigious Short-Title Catalogue Netherlands (STCN) Project completed after 27 years.</p><p>The largest and longest-running project in the history of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek is virtually complete. The 'Short-Title Catalogue Netherlands' (STCN), which was completed in July 2009, gives an overview of all books printed in the Netherlands between 1540 and 1801 and of those published abroad in Dutch. This milestone marks the completion of the National Bibliography from the beginning of the printing age up to the present day.</p><p>The STCN was compiled from the collections of almost 25 libraries and archives in the Netherlands and abroad. Among these were the Koninklijke Bibliotheek (KB) and the university libraries of Amsterdam, Leiden, Utrecht, the Free University, Groningen and Nijmegen, as well as the British Library, the provincial libraries of Friesland and Zeeland, the municipal libraries of Haarlem, Rotterdam and Deventer and the collections of the Netherlands Music Institute and the Meermanno Museum.</p><p>In addition to numerous scientific publications, the bibliography comprises many books for 'the man in the street', such as travel stories, political pamphlets and almanacs. Four different bibliographies had already been compiled for the periods before 1540 and after 1800, but the publications from the period 1540-1800 have now been brought together in one database for the first time. More than 200,000 different titles came onto the market during this flourishing period of Dutch books. Around 500,000 copies are listed in the STCN. The five different bibliographies will be accessible via one portal within two years.</p><p>The STCN is pre-eminently suitable as a scholarly research instrument. The database provides several more search functions than an ordinary library catalogue. The user can search for author's names and title words as well as year, place of publication, language, printer, publisher, key words, and even illustrations, musical notation and typeface. Moreover, the STCN will be the starting point for large-scale digitisation projects of the KB and other libraries.</p><p><a href="http://www.kb.nl/stcn/index-en.html">http://www.kb.nl/stcn/index-en.html</a></p><p>[Source: Koninklijke Bibliotheek]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: July 2009</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news4"></a></p><h2>JumpBox Delivers 2-minute Install of the DSpace Open Source Repository Software</h2><p>JumpBox, publisher of virtual appliances that provide the means to trial, develop, and deploy Open Source applications, recently announced the availability of the JumpBox for DSpace. This addition marks the fiftieth JumpBox in its growing catalogue of time-saving virtual appliances for Open Source software.</p><p>DSpace is an open source application that enables organisations to manage, share and preserve their research output. The software is primarily used by academia and cultural heritage institutions that want to share their research output and ensure the content persists over time. The DSpace application was created through a collaboration between MIT and HP Labs, and is now used by over 500 organisations around the world. DSpace supports all forms of digital media including, images, audio, movies, text and other rich media.</p><p>'We know of many organizations that would like to get started with DSpace but do not have the technical support or know how', says Michele Kimpton, Executive Director of the DSpace Foundation. 'JumpBox allows them to deploy DSpace in a self-contained fashion in minutes minimizing the effort necessary to get up and running. This translates to a simplified evaluation process for schools and reduced installation cost and headache.'</p><p>'Consistent with our goal of helping people be more productive with Open Source software, we're thrilled to be able to make this JumpBox available as a free resource for the DSpace community and to support the DSpace project and its principles.' says Kimbro Staken, CEO of JumpBox Inc.</p><p>The JumpBox for DSpace runs under virtualisation on every major operating system and is available for immediate download via the DSpace Web site:</p><p><a href="http://www.dspace.org/index.php/News-Archive/JumpBox-Install-of-DSpace.html">http://www.dspace.org/index.php/News-Archive/JumpBox-Install-of-DSpace.html</a></p><p><a href="http://www.jumpbox.com">http://www.jumpbox.com</a></p><p><a href="http://twitter.com/duraspace">http://twitter.com/duraspace</a></p><p>[Source: JumpBox/DSpace]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: June 2009</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news5"></a></p><h2>Final Digital Britain Report Now Available</h2><p>The final Digital Britain Report was published on 16 June 2009 and the text and other information about the Report can be found on: <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/broadcasting/5631.aspx">http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/broadcasting/5631.aspx</a></p><p>Victoria Coker, Senior Policy Advisor on the Digital Britain Report at the Department for Business, Enterprise &amp; Regulatory Reform expressed her gratitude to all stakeholders for the input they provided on Digital Britain issues which had helped to shape the final Report.</p><p>[Source: Dept. for Business, Enterprise &amp; Regulatory Reform]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: June 2009</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news6"></a></p><h2>Understanding the Next-Gen User</h2><p>An archived version of the Library Journal webcast "Understanding the Next-Gen User" is now available.
