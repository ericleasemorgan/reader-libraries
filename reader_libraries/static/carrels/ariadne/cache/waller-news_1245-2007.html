Libraries are not storage places any more; they are less and less a place. The critical issues now include: How can that information be efficiently accessed and used? How do we extract knowledge from such an abundance of often poorly organized information? How might these enormous digital resources affect our concept of identity, our privacy, and the way we conduct business in the new century? Insight from many disciplines and perspectives is requisite to begin to understand this phenomenon to identify ways to help chart a future course. The De Lange 2007 Conference will examine the transformational influences these astonishing emerging libraries may entail.</p><p>For more detailed information about the speakers and programme, see <a href="http://delange.rice.edu/conferenceVI.cfm">http://delange.rice.edu/conferenceVI.cfm</a></p><p align="right"><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events3"></a></p><h3>UKeiG Course: Virtual Rules OK? Developing a Policy for the Digital Collection</h3><p>The John Rylands University Library, University of Manchester, 28 March, 2007</p><p><strong>Course outline</strong><br>One of the greatest responsibilities librarians have is that of developing and managing a pertinent and dynamic collection - indeed, it may be one of the fundamental arts of the librarian. Collection management comprises a series of complex activities and procedures which now encompass the virtual collection as well as the physical collection. These activities include selection, evaluation, acquisition, collection evaluation and review, preservation and promotion.</p><p>If such activities are to be undertaken in a coherent and consistent fashion, one of the requirements is that the librarian establishes and administers a pragmatic written collection development policy (CDP).</p><p>The overarching aim of the workshop is to enable you to formulate or re-evaluate and implement a CDP for e-resources for your library. By the end of the workshop you should:</p><ul><li>Understand the nature and content of a CDP</li><li>Be aware of the policy issues surrounding e-resources</li><li>Appreciate the value and uses of a CDP</li><li>Understand the issues surrounding the implementation and administration of the policy</li><li>Know how to promote the policy within your institution or authority</li></ul><p>The workshop will involve practical work. In addition to talks and demonstrations from the workshop leaders, you will be undertaking small group exercises of different kinds.</p><p>If your library already has a CDP, then you are encouraged to bring a copy to the workshop.</p><p><strong>Course Presenters</strong><br>Ray Lonsdale, Reader in Information Studies at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth.

Digitisation offers unprecedented opportunities for access to historical materials. But how can it be combined with established preservation methods in an integrated strategy, to ensure optimal access today as well as in the future? In this 5-day workshop, the characteristics of film, video and sound recordings and the different recording systems and devices will be reviewed. Specific requirements for their handling and preservation will be related to the nature and function of different kinds of audiovisual materials. The workshop will explore the different transfer and conversion methods, technical requirements in relation to quality, and long-term management of digital files. Issues will be approached as management problems, and due attention will be given to aspects like needs assessment, setting priorities, planning, budgeting and outsourcing, as well as project management.</p><p>Participants will acquire knowledge of technical issues that will enable them to make informed decisions about the role of digitisation in care and management of audiovisual collections. The speakers will present outlines of issues and practical cases, and a substantial part of the workshops will be spent on discussions and group assignments to develop participants' skills in finding their own solutions.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong><br>All those responsible for audiovisual collections in archives, museums and libraries. For this introductory course, no specific technical expertise is required. The workshop will be in English.</p><p><strong>Organisation</strong><br>European Commission on Preservation and Access, Amsterdam, the Netherlands The workshops are supported by the Culture 2000-programme of the EU as = part of the TAPE project</p><p><strong>Registration fee</strong><br>600 euros, this includes coffees, teas, lunches and a course pack with reading materials.

Application profiles provide the means to document the use of metadata terms within specific contexts and to combine terms from disparate namespaces. Application profiles may apply to communities of practice (e.g. cooperation projects) as well as to organizations in the public and private sectors. Emerging experience in the creation of application profiles reveals layers of complexity involved in combining terms from mixed abstract models. DC-2007 seeks to explore the conceptual and practical issues in the development and deployment of application profiles to meet the needs of specific communities of practice.</p><p>In addition to contributions focusing on the DC-2007 conference theme, papers and workshop proposals are welcome on a wide range of metadata topics, such as:</p><p>Accessibility<br>Business Models for Metadata<br>Conceptual Models<br>Cross-domain Processes (e.g., Recordkeeping, Preservation, Institutional Repositories)<br>Domain Metadata (e.g., Commerce, Corporate/Enterprise, Cultural Heritage Institutions - (Museums, Libaries, and Archives), Education, Geo-Spatial, Government, Social Spaces)<br>Metadata Generation Processes (e.g., Human, Automatic, and Hybrid)<br>Metadata Harvesting<br>Multilingual Issues<br>Interoperability<br>Knowledge Organisation Systems (e.g., Ontologies, Taxonomies, and Thesauri)<br>Localisation and Internationalisation<br>Normalisation and Crosswalks<br>Quality and Evaluation<br>Registries and Registry Services<br>Search Engines and Metadata<br>Social Tagging</p><p><strong>Submissions Deadlines and Important Dates</strong><br>Submission of papers: 2 April 2007<br>Acceptance notification: 1 June 2007<br>Camera-ready copy due: 2 July 2007</p><p align="right"><br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events10"></a></p><h3>Libraries Without Walls 7: Exploring anywhere, anytime delivery of library services</h3><p>Lesvos, Greece, 14 - 18 September 2007<br><a href="http://www.cerlim.ac.uk/conf/lww7/">http://www.cerlim.ac.uk/conf/lww7/</a></p><p>An international conference organised by The Centre for Research in Library and Information Management (CERLIM)<br><a href="http://www.cerlim.ac.uk/">http://www.cerlim.ac.uk/</a></p><p>To be held on the Aegean Island of Lesvos, Greece, at the Delphinia Hotel, Molyvos<br><a href="http://www.molyvoshotel.com/eng/hotel.htm">http://www.molyvoshotel.com/eng/hotel.htm</a></p><p><strong>Cost</strong><br>Cost 495 GBP (including accommodation and breakfast for four nights, with lunches and refreshments during the Conference, and two evening dinners)</p><p><strong>Keynote Speaker</strong><br>Christine Borgman, Professor &amp; Presidential Chair in Information Studies within the Graduate School of Education &amp; Information Studies at the University of California Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>Conference Themes</strong><br>From their beginnings in 1995, the Libraries without Walls conferences have mapped a major change in the practice of librarianship. While library services are still concerned to provide users with physical access to their buildings, electronic access, often from remote locations, is becoming ever more dominant. Library services are being integrated into virtual learning, research and personal environments. Papers presented at previous LWW conferences have mapped this change and provided examples of how libraries are delivering their services whenever and wherever their users need them.</p><p>LWW7 wishes to encourage the widest possible range of papers to reflect the diverse current developments in library service delivery and anticipates that papers may cover:</p><ul><li>New kinds of service, especially those which open up new paradigms of library - perhaps the library equivalent of YouTube or MySpace?</li><li>Papers which describe the library's role within new models of scholarly publishing, including experience of developing services based on institutional or other repositories, and papers examining the responsibility of the library for digital curation.</li><li>Service delivery in challenging environments, especially where the infrastructure may be sub-optimal as in some developing countries, or where the user group represents particular challenges.</li><li>New technological solutions, provided these are presented to illustrate the impact on users of the improved services they make possible</li><li>Delivery and assessment of information skills/literacies, especially where this is achieved through electronic environments.</li></ul><p>As in the past these themes are indicative and LWW7 remains open to proposals which, while in the general area of interest of the conference, do not fit neatly into the defined themes.</p><p>In addition to research papers, papers based on truly innovative practice will be welcomed, but these should assess the more general lessons to be learned rather than simply presenting a localised case study.</p><p><strong>Submissions</strong><br>Closing date for submissions: Submissions by Friday 2nd March 2007.

What would happen today if a publisher were to close down, a publication were discontinued or a library or research laboratory were to cancel a subscription?</p><p>To guarantee that researchers will have long-term access to scientific publications, the Institute for Scientific and Technical Information (INIST) of the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) became the first French member of the LOCKSS Alliance.</p><h4>LOCKSS (Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe)</h4><p>The LOCKSS Alliance was founded in 2004 and about a hundred libraries around the world are members. They form a community centered around the use of LOCKSS, a free software for preserving electronic journals to which they subscribe.</p><p>The LOCKSS Project was launched in 1999 in the United-States. In 2002, Stanford University was selected, after an initial test phase, to develop the software which was released in April 2004. LOCKSS operates as a network of journal duplicates associated with a control protocol. Then, to ensure its preservation, a journal only needs to be archived on six different sites in the world. Therefore LOCKSS is a cost-effective solution, since members no longer need to save their entire digital collections.</p><p>For further details about the LOCKSS Alliance:<br><a href="http://www.lockss.org/alliance/alliance.htm">http://www.lockss.org/alliance/alliance.htm</a></p><p>The CNRS's Institute for Scientific and Technical Information:<br>For over a decade and a half, INIST-CNRS has been fostering the dissemination of research findings through services facilitating access to scientific information.

It also calls on the Commission to explore a European-wide approach to policies and practices surrounding the development of digital repositories as a means of making more visible the fruits of European research and maximising the return on public investment in research.</p><p>In January 2006 the European Commission published the <em>Study on the economic and technical evolution of the scientific publication markets of Europe</em>. The Study resulted from a detailed analysis of the current scholarly journal publication market, together with extensive consultation with all the major stakeholders within the scholarly communication process (researchers, funders, publishers, librarians, research policymakers, etc.). The Study noted that 'dissemination and access to research results is a pillar in the development of the European Research Area' and it made a number of balanced and reasonable recommendations to improve the visibility and usefulness of European research outputs.</p><p>Now, a year after publication of the Study, JISC, along with its partners, is urging the EC to endorse the recommendations in full. 'Research must be widely disseminated and read to be useful,' the petition suggests, going on to outline the economic advantages of widening access to publicly funded research, including the encouragement of further research and promotion of European research outputs worldwide.</p><p>Rachel Bruce, JISC director, Information Environment, said: 'Over the past year there has been significant progress in improving access to publicly funded research.
