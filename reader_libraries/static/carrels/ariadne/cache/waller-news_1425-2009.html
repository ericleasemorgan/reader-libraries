Do you want to discuss your strategies for digital preservation with colleagues and experts? Do you know how to preserve your collections for the future? Do you know which tools and services to use for this?</p><p>There has been an explosion in the volume of information world-wide which will grow to 180 exabytes by 2011. But if action is not taken, that information can be lost within five to ten years.</p><p><strong>Digital Preservation – The Planets Way</strong> is an opportunity to understand what may be done to manage digital content for the long-term.

These tools attempt to model the underlying semantic structure of a domain for purposes of information retrieval, knowledge discovery, language engineering, and the semantic web. The workshop provides an opportunity to report and discuss projects, research, and development related to Networked Knowledge Organization Systems/Services in next-generation digital libraries.</p><p>Modern digital information systems afford more options for mapping and presenting alternative orders of information than traditional physical libraries. The digital environment offers more possibilities of relating information and knowledge structures from different interests and discourses. Thus, the challenge is as much intellectual as technical when we want to develop and map knowledge organization systems that are useful and meaningful for the end-users operating in complex, interdisciplinary knowledge domains.</p><p>The workshop would address the general themes presented below, although the workshop is not limited to the predefined topics and remains open to other issues emerging from presentation proposals. Two important new themes for this workshop are Linked Data and KOS development methods. The workshop this year also invites proposals for posters.</p><h4>Topics</h4><ul><li>Linked data on the Web</li><li>Models and methodologies for creation and development of KOS, its vocabulary and relations, and connected services</li><li>Social tagging</li><li>KOS Interoperability</li><li>Terminology services</li><li>User-centred design issues</li><li>Semantic Web applications and implications of KOS</li><li>Economic and social issues in the context of KOS creation, maintenance and application</li></ul><h4>Proposals are invited for the following</h4><ol><li>presentations</li><li>posters</li></ol><p>Please email proposals (approximately 500 words for presentations and 200 words for posters, including aims, methods, main findings) by June 19th to Koraljka Golub (k.golub@ukoln.ac.uk).

Could you help?</p><p>Although JISC has funded the development of a number of services (e.g. JORUM, JISCmail) specifically for use within the UK HE sector, people within the sector are increasingly using services developed outside the sector, either in addition to - or in some cases instead of – JISC-provided services. In addition to using such services, people are also engaging in 'mashups' where combinations of services and content are used to provide new services or to provide added value to data already held.</p><p>The main focus of the study is to find out the Web 2.0 tools and services that people are using, and the reasons for choosing them (especially if they decided against using a JISC service that was available). A number of approaches will be used to collect evidence from people working in the HE sector – these approaches will themselves include the use of Web 2.0 tools and services.</p><p>One evidence collection approach is the study blog. In order to get feedback the blog has been set up with a series of pages, each looking at a different task that Web 2.0 services enables people to do; people can add comments to the various individual pages. The next stage will be to identify and contact individuals who routinely use several tools and services as case studies.</p><p>The study team would like to hear from as many people as possible. The study timescale is short, so the team would like people to do the following as soon as possible:</p><ul><li>Visit the blog and add your comments</li><li>Encourage colleagues to participate – e.g. post on email lists</li><li>Contact the study team if you would like to be a case study.</li></ul><p>As a thank you, a small number of Amazon vouchers will be awarded to some lucky participants in a draw.</p><p><strong>Further information:</strong><br>See <a href="http://blogs.ukoln.ac.uk/jisc-sis-landscape/">http://blogs.ukoln.ac.uk/jisc-sis-landscape/</a><br>or contact:<br>Ann Chapman <a href="mailto:a.d.chapman@ukoln.ac.uk">a.d.chapman@ukoln.ac.uk</a><br>Rosemary Russell <a href="mailto:r.russell@ukoln.ac.uk">r.russell@ukoln.ac.uk</a></p><p>[Source: UKOLN]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: June 2009</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news2"></a></p><h3>Evaluating Tools for Automated Subject Metadata Generation</h3><p>EASTER (Evaluating Automated Subject Tools for Enhancing Retrieval) is an 18-month project funded under the JISC Information Environment Programme 2009-11. It started in April 2009 and involves eight institutional partners, with UKOLN as lead organisation, University of Glamorgan, Intute, City University London and Dagobert Soergel being major partners, as well as Royal School Library and Information Science, University College London, and OCLC Office of Research as non-funded supporting partners.</p><p>The purpose of the project is to test and evaluate existing tools for automated subject metadata generation in order to better understand what is possible, what the limitations of current solutions are, and make subsequent recommendations for services employing subject metadata in the JISC community.</p><p>The project is concerned both with the creation and with the enrichment of subject metadata using existing automated tools. Subject metadata are most important in resource discovery, yet most expensive to produce manually. In addition, they are much more difficult to generate automatically, especially in comparison to formal metadata such as file type, title, etc. Also, due to the high cost of evaluation, automated subject metadata tools are rarely tested in live environments of use. There is a huge challenge facing UK HE digital collections, institutional repositories and aggregators of institutional repository content as to how to provide high quality subject metadata for ever-increasing amounts of digital information at reasonable cost.</p><p>The information centre chosen as a test-bed for this project will be Intute. Selected tools for automated subject metadata generation will be tested in two contexts: by Intute cataloguers in the cataloguing workflow; and by end-users of Intute who search for information in Intute as part of their research, learning, and information management.</p><p>The project will first develop a methodology for evaluating the tools. The methodology will then be implemented in the above contexts. First, all tools will be evaluated for results using a devised 'gold standard'. The best tool(s) for the purposes of Intute will be implemented into a demonstrator that will feed its results into the cataloguing workflow which will then be evaluated. Furthermore, a task-based study of end-users' retrieval actions will be conducted to determine the contribution of automatically assigned terms, and manually assigned terms, both alone and in combination, to retrieval success (i.e. retrieving relevant documents) and failure (missing relevant documents and retrieving irrelevant ones).</p><p><strong>Further information:</strong><br><a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/projects/easter/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/projects/easter/</a></p><p>[Source: UKOLN]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: May 2009</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news3"></a></p><h3>Fedora Commons and DSpace Foundation Join to Create the DuraSpace Organization</h3><p>Fedora Commons and the DSpace Foundation, two of the largest providers of open source software for managing and providing access to digital content, have announced that they will join up to pursue a common mission. Jointly, they will provide leadership and innovation in open source technologies for global communities which manage, preserve, and provide access to digital content.</p><p>The combined organization, named "DuraSpace," will sustain and grow its flagship repository platforms - Fedora and DSpace. DuraSpace will also expand its portfolio by offering new technologies and services that respond to the dynamic environment of the Web and to new requirements from existing and future users. DuraSpace will focus on supporting existing communities and will also engage a larger and more diverse group of stakeholders in support of its not-for-profit mission. The organization will be led by an executive team consisting of Sandy Payette (Chief Executive Officer), Michele Kimpton (Chief Business Officer), and Brad McLean (Chief Technology Officer) and will operate out of offices in Ithaca, New York State and Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.</p><p>"This is a great development," said Clifford Lynch, Executive Director of the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI). "It will focus resources and talent in a way that should really accelerate progress in areas critical to the research, education, and cultural memory communities. The new emphasis on distributed reliable storage infrastructure services and their integration with repositories is particularly timely."</p><p>Together Fedora and DSpace make up the largest market share of open repositories worldwide, serving over 700 institutions.

The specific aim was to determine whether vocabulary control and the use of established knowledge organization systems can assist in moving free social tagging beyond personal bookmarking to aid resource discovery.</p><p>The Intute digital collection and the STFC repository were used as two test beds. For each a separate demonstrator was developed (see <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/projects/enhanced-tagging/demonstrators/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/projects/enhanced-tagging/demonstrators/</a>) and a user study conducted. Three major methods were adopted to collect user data, namely logs analysis, questionnaires, and interviews. The evaluation of the Intute demonstrator involved comparing basic and advanced systems for indexing and retrieval implications. The test setting comprised 28 students in political science and 60 documents covering 4 topics of relevance to the students. Dewey Decimal Classification was used. The STFC study involved 10 authors and depositors. The ACM Computing Classification Scheme was employed.</p><p>The results showed the importance of controlled vocabulary suggestions for both indexing and retrieval in order to: help produce ideas of the tags to use; make it easier to find a focus for the tagging; as well as to ensure consistency and increase the number of access points in retrieval. Much depended on the quality of the suggestions, both in terms of conceptual relevance to the user and in appropriateness of the terminology. The participants themselves could also see the advantages of controlled vocabulary terms for retrieval if the terms used were from an authoritative source.</p><p><strong>Further information:</strong><br>All results are made available at the EnTag dissemination Web page <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/projects/enhanced-tagging/dissemination/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/projects/enhanced-tagging/dissemination/</a></p><p>[Source: UKOLN]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: May 2009</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="news7"></a></p><h3>RCUK Publishes Report on Open Access Study</h3><p>Research Councils UK has published an independent study commissioned by the Research Councils into open access to research outputs.

The study timescale is short, so the team would like people to do the following as soon as possible:</p><ul><li>Visit the blog and add your comments</li><li>Encourage colleagues to participate – e.g. post on email lists</li><li>Contact the study team if you would like to be a case study.</li></ul><p>As a thank you, a small number of Amazon vouchers will be awarded to some lucky participants in a draw.</p><p>Ann Chapman <a href="mailto:a.d.chapman@ukoln.ac.uk">a.d.chapman@ukoln.ac.uk</a> and Rosemary Russell <a href="mailto:r.russell@ukoln.ac.uk">r.russell@ukoln.ac.uk</a></p><p>URL: <a href="http://blogs.ukoln.ac.uk/jisc-sis-landscape/">http://blogs.ukoln.ac.uk/jisc-sis-landscape/</a></p><p align="right">[<em>Received: June 2009</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p class="right"><a href="newsline.html#top"><small>Return to top</small></a></p><!-- this group of ssi's will work only when Ariadne 38 folder is in place with the relevant ssi files added --><p class="footer">Publication Date: 30-April-2009 Publication: Ariadne Issue 59<br>Originating URL: http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue59/newsline/</p>
