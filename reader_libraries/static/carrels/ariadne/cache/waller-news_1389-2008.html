It will take place at its London offices on Tuesday 18 November 2008.</p><p>Speakers have been secured from across the NEETs community from: The Department for Children Schools and Families; The Learning and Skills Council; The Adult Institute of Adult Continuing Education; The Reading Agency; and the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council. Two county councils and two London borough councils will also present case studies.</p><p>The aim is to help clarify the thinking of Government Departments and agencies to NEETs and explain the implications for public funding. The speakers will debate the issues with delegates and help develop recommendations for LIS in supporting NEETs to answer the question 'What role can alternative providers play in engaging NEET young people?'</p><p>The Briefing is supported by CILIP's <em>Update</em> magazine, and will be restricted to 50 delegates to encourage discussion.

The intention is to bring together key stakeholders, the repository managers and preservation experts, at a practical focussed event to talk together and share perspectives, requirements, problems and solutions. It is hoped that the workshop will lead to collective recommendations for what the next moves for repository managers and preservation specialists should be to provide practical focussed support, services and tools. The workshop should in addition further repository managers' understanding of how to implement preservation strategies and processes.</p><p>As well as the formal presentations there will also be a marketplace when there will be an opportunity to view posters, and engage with project teams and see demonstrations of the latest tools. The day will close with a participative discussion session. Prior to the event the organisers will gather concerns and requirements from repository managers and preservation experts/services and synthesise them into 'Top 5 Concerns', 'Top 5 Wishes' and 'Top 5 Solutions' (for practical implementation). They will then be collated to form the basis for the panel discussion.</p><h3>Who should attend?</h3><p>Repository managers, librarians, archivists, digital preservation experts, information management specialists, service providers.</p><h3>Benefits of attendance</h3><ul><li>An opportunity to share preservations issues, (concerns, wishes, solutions) with peers and experts.</li><li>To gain insight from repository managers on how they are approaching preservation on different platforms.</li><li>To get up to speed with the outcomes from existing services and projects working in this important area.</li><li>To gain some tips from fellow practitioners on what works for them.</li><li>To share digital preservation expertise with the repository community.</li></ul><p>For further information, please visit: <a href="http://www.dpconline.org/graphics/events/081212RepMngrsWkshp.html">http://www.dpconline.org/graphics/events/081212RepMngrsWkshp.html</a></p><p align="right"><br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events5"></a></p><h3>Digital Futures Academy 2009: London and Sydney</h3><p>King's College London has announced the Digital Futures 5-day training event<br>"Digital Futures Academy: from digitization to delivery"<br>London, UK: 27 April - 1 May 2009<br>Sydney, Australia: 2 - 6 February 2009<br><a href="http://www.digitalconsultancy.net/digifutures/">http://www.digitalconsultancy.net/digifutures/</a></p><p>For 2009 we have 2 instances of Digital Futures, one in Sydney, Australia and another in London, UK.</p><p>Led by experts of international renown, Digital Futures focuses on the creation, delivery and preservation of digital resources from cultural and memory institutions.

JCDL encompasses the many meanings of the term 'digital libraries' including (but not limited to) new forms of information institutions; operational information systems with all manner of digital content; new means of selecting, collecting, organising, and distributing digital content; and theoretical models of information media, including document genres and electronic publishing.</p><p>Digital libraries may be viewed as a new form of information institution or as an extension of the services libraries currently provide. Representatives from academe, government, industry, and others are invited to participate in this annual conference. The conference draws from a broad array of disciplines including computer science, information science, librarianship, archival science and practice, museum studies and practice, technology, medicine, social sciences, and humanities. JCDL 2009 will be held in Austin, Texas. JCDL 2009 is hosted by the School of Information at the University of Texas, and is organised by an international committee of scholars and leaders in the Digital Libraries field. Four hundred delegates are expected for the five days of events including a day of cutting-edge tutorials; 3 days of papers, panels, and keynotes; and a day of research workshops.</p><p>For further information: <a href="http://www.jcdl2009.org/">http://www.jcdl2009.org/</a></p><p align="right"><br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p><a name="events7"></a></p><h3>ISKO UK: Content Architecture: Exploiting and Managing Diverse Resources</h3><p>Biennial Conference of the British Chapter of the International Society for Knowledge<br>Organization (ISKO UK)<br>University College London, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT<br>22-23 June 2009<br><a href="http://www.iskouk.org/conf2009/">http://www.iskouk.org/conf2009/</a></p><p>The ISKO UK 2009 conference "Content Architecture: Exploiting and Managing Diverse Resources" will address issues in the organization and integration of text, images, data and voice - multimedia and multilingual.

These standards provide the foundation for applications and services that can visualise, preserve, transfer, summarise, and improve access to the aggregations that people use in their daily Web interaction: including multiple page Web documents, multiple format documents in institutional repositories, scholarly datasets, and online photo and music collections. The OAI-ORE standards leverage the core Web architecture and concepts emerging from related efforts including the semantic web, linked data, and Atom syndication. As a result, they integrate both with the emerging machine-readable Web, Web 2.0, and the future evolution of networked information.</p><p>The production versions of the OAI-ORE specifications and implementation documents are now available to the public, with a table of contents page at <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/toc">http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/toc</a>. This public release is the culmination of several months of testing and review of initial alpha and beta releases. The participation and feedback from the wider OAI-ORE community, especially the OAI-ORE technical committee, was instrumental to the process leading up to this production release.</p><p>The documents in the release describe a data model to introduce aggregations as resources with URIs on the Web. They also detail the machine-readable descriptions of aggregations expressed in the popular Atom syndication format, in RDF/XML, and RDFa. The documents included in the release are:</p><h3>ORE User Guide Documents</h3><ul><li>Primer <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/primer.html">http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/primer.html</a></li><li>Resource Map Implementation in Atom <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/atom.html">http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/atom.html</a></li><li>Resource Map Implementation in RDF/XML <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/rdfxml.html">http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/rdfxml.html</a></li><li>Resource Map Implementation in RDFa <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/rdfa.html">http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/rdfa.html</a></li><li>HTTP Implementation <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/http.html">http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/http.html</a></li><li>Resource Map Discovery <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/discovery.html">http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/discovery.html</a></li></ul><h3>ORE Specification Documents</h3><ul><li>Abstract Data Model <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/datamodel.html">http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/datamodel.html</a></li><li>Vocabulary <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/vocabulary.html">http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/vocabulary.html</a></li><li>Tools and Additional Resources <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/tools.html">http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/tools.html</a></li></ul><h3>Further information</h3><p>Full press release:<br><a href="http://www.openarchives.org/documents/ore-production-press-release.pdf">http://www.openarchives.org/documents/ore-production-press-release.pdf</a></p><p>[Source: Carl Lagoze, Cornell University; Herbert Van de Sompel, Los Alamos National Laboratory]</p><p align="right">[<em>Received: October 2008</em>]<br><small><a href="newsline.html#headlines">Back to headlines</a></small></p><hr><p>Publication Date: 30-October-2008 Publication: Ariadne Issue 57</p><p class="footer">Originating URL: http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue57/newsline/</p>
